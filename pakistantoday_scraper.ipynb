            "The launch of report was jointly organized by the Alliance for Climate Justice and Clean Energy (ACJCE), a voluntary network of think tanks, civil society organizations, activists and academics, and its founding member organization, Policy Research Institute for Equitable Development (PRIED).\n",

            "ISLAMABAD: Traditional tobacco control measures have reached a plateau, prompting the call for a shift towards more effective and globally accepted ‘tobacco harm reduction’ (THR) strategies. Renowned researcher and policy advisor, Dr. Muhammad Rizwan Junaid, emphasized the urgent need for these strategies to save over 1.2 million lives in Pakistan. \n",
            "Speaking at the ‘Break Thru Science’ round table discussion organized by ‘Irada,’ Dr. Rizwan highlighted the potential of THR products in reducing toxic exposures by 80% and decreasing tobacco-related premature deaths by 70%.\n",
            "Referring to the research study ‘Integrating Harm Reduction Into Tobacco Control’ conducted in London, Dr. Rizwan underscored the importance of providing policymakers and public health experts with estimates of the potential benefits of tobacco harm reduction. The study revealed that countries like Pakistan, South Africa, Bangladesh, and Kazakhstan could significantly save lives through the widespread adoption of THR strategies.\n",
            "In particular, the study indicated that Pakistan stands to save 1.2 million lives by incorporating THR strategies into its tobacco control policies. Dr. Rizwan urged the government to recognize the transformative potential of THR products, already utilized by 112 million people worldwide, in addressing this national crisis.\n",
            "Highlighting advancements in biotechnology, pharmaceutical innovation, and diagnostics over the past two decades, Dr. Rizwan pointed out the development of THR products meeting the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) criteria for protecting public health.\n",
            "Experts at the round table discussion drew attention to the success of tobacco harm reduction strategies in European countries, where a significant decrease in smoking figures has been observed. The European Union (EU) has set the ambitious goal of becoming smoke-free by 2040, with a primary focus on adopting THR to drive down smoking rates and reduce related mortality and morbidity.\n",
            "During the discussion, health experts urged the government to incorporate tobacco harm reduction strategies into public health regulatory frameworks. Emphasizing the importance of proportional regulations on nicotine products based on health risks, they stressed the need to make healthier choices easily accessible.\n",
            "The initiative ‘Irada’ was acknowledged as a platform recognizing the crucial role tobacco harm reduction plays in minimizing the health impact of smoking in Pakistan. As the country faces a critical juncture in tobacco control, the adoption of THR strategies emerges as a pivotal solution to save lives and promote public health.\n",

            "The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) on Tuesday reserved its decision on shifting a burden exceeding Rs 22 billion to all the electricity consumers of the country.\n",
            "Earlier, power distribution companies (XWDISCOs) filed request with NEPRA for adjustments on account of capacity charges, transmission charges & market operator fee, the impact of incremental units and impact of T & D losses on FCA and variables operation & maintenance charges for the 1st quarter of FY 2023-24 i-e July to September 2023, in line with the notified mechanism in this regard. And, the NEPRA on Tuesday conducted hearing on the application of XWDISCOs under the chairmanship of NEPRA chairman Waseem Mukhtar and announced that it would issue final decision later.\n",
            "NEPRA officials, during the course of hearing, said that XWDISCOs have sought a total increase of more than Rs22 billion and 56 crore and its impact will come depending on which month this quarterly adjustment is received from the consumers. They said if the increase in power tariff is approved then the power tariff hike in the next three months will be around Rs 1.25 per unit. They said XWDISCOs reduced power purchase in July, August and September as their purchase of power was decreased by 9.50 percent. XWDISCOs purchased total 38 billion units instead of 42 billion, said NEPRA officials.\n",
            "Adjustments could have been negative if the figures were as per reference cost, they added.\n",
            "Responding to a question, NEPRA officials clarified that increase in power tariff will be applicable to all customers across the country under quarterly adjustment because uniform increase will be applied across the country on the direction of the federal government.

            "Honda has a pricing problem. If it wasn’t clear enough when they introduced the Honda Civic back in January 2022 at the price of Rs 60 lakh (which has since risen to the Rs 1 crore mark), it should by now have become a player with how Honda has handled their latest attempt at rejuvenation: The HR-V.   \n",
            "As a car it is one you would expect to do well. It boasts the distinction of being the first indigenously produced Japanese crossover-sports utility vehicle (C-SUV) in Pakistan. Not only this, the HR-V was the first C-SUV launched by one of the “Big Three” (Suzuki, Toyota, and Honda) car companies in Pakistan. The hype surrounding it was justified, and Honda hit the ground running with it. The vehicle was fully booked for the first six months merely a day after its launch. \n",
            "But that is all in the past. \n",
            "Sales of the car have since nosedived. It has also tanked on the secondary market making it an undesirable car in terms of resale value. This fall has been bad enough that the HR-V is now being sold on interest free instalments in a two year plan. That is how desperate Honda seems to have gotten to wash their hands of the car. So what went wrong? \n",
            "Our story starts with a different car in a different era. Back in 2014-15, the Pakistani car market was facing an influx of refurbished Japanese cars. The Toyota Vitz was possibly the most successful of these cars but there were other iconic four wheelers too. The Toyota Passo and Prius were both famous on this market as well. But Honda’s contribution to this was the Vezel. \n",
            "Article continues after this advertisement\n",
            "Vezel is the name that the HR-V has on the Japanese domestic market. At the time, a Honda Vezel in good shape would sell at a range of Rs 35 lakh to Rs 36 lakh at a time when the Toyota Corolla and Honda Civic were around Rs 10 lakhs cheaper than this. But the Vezel was not a sedan. As one of the first crossover SUVs to hit the Pakistani market it immediately made its place in the car circuit in Pakistan. In fact, the Vezel was an early herald to another iconic car: The KIA Sportage which hit markets in 2020.  \n",
            "Before Lucky Motors heralded the arrival of the KIA Sportage, Pakistan’s C-SUV landscape was barren, compelling consumers to depend on an assortment of imported vehicles to bridge the market void. The nonexistence of a C-SUV at the in Pakistan did not signify a dearth of demand for one. The Vezel was the precursor of the Sportage, and the C-SUV sensation. By 2014-15, consumers had grown familiar with auction sheets, a development that coincided with Pakistan’s resolution to peg its currency to the dollar. These elements collectively fuelled the Vezel’s meteoric rise in popularity. So much so that Honda  launched the global rendition of the Vezel, the HR-V, in 2016.\n",
            "The 2016 HR-V was a completely built-up unit (CBU) — a fully imported entity — whereas the current version is a completely knocked down (CKD) unit. Consequently, the 2016 HR-V does not lay claim to the accolade of being the inaugural locally manufactured Japanese C-SUV. That distinction is reserved for the present iteration. The fact that the 2016 model failed to secure this honour, despite its launch over half a decade ago, speaks volumes about the market’s reception of the vehicle.\n",
            "The CBU HR-V’s debut in Pakistan in January 2016 was met with lukewarm response, as the vehicle was under-equipped and overpriced in comparison to the Vezel offered by importers. To provide some context, the Vezel was a hybrid, equipped with a 1.5-litre internal combustion engine and a 30 hp electric motor. The HR-V, in contrast, was fitted with a standard 1.5-litre internal combustion engine — identical to the engine powering the more budget-friendly Honda City at the time. The HR-V bore a price tag of approximately Rs 36 lakh, while the Vezel was priced at Rs 34 lakh. The Vezel also enjoyed the benefits of superior quality of life features and enhanced build quality. Ultimately, by 2018, Honda decided to discontinue the HR-V altogether.\n",
            "Despite all this, Honda knew that the HR-V had the potential to be a big seller. They also knew that to have the best shot at selling it they would have to introduce the latest shape, model, and make of the car to convince people to buy it. In October 2022 the HR-V had a successful launch. Merely a day post-launch, the company was inundated with bookings stretching well into the early months of the following year. Within a week, whispers began to circulate that the vehicle was sold out until spring, and perhaps even beyond. \n",
            "However, charting the HR-V’s triumphant trajectory is no simple task. Honda, in its monthly sales report to the Pakistan Automotive Manufacturers Association (PAMA), merges the HR-V’s sales figures with those of the BR-V. Consequently, discerning the individual sales of each model becomes a challenge. While some third-party reports provide inklings about the composition of Honda’s sales, the company itself remains tight-lipped, leaving everyone in a state of speculation. We find ourselves in the same boat.\n",
            "Our analysis delved into the five-year history, spanning from September 2019 to September 2023, of the HR-V/BR-V category in Honda’s sales filing to PAMA. Our objective was to gauge the growth in sales volume of the category since the HR-V’s introduction. The combined category of the HR-V, and BR-V accounted for a total of 2,962 vehicles sold from January 2022 to October 2022. In stark contrast, from November 2022 to March 2023, the category registered 3,262 sales, marking a 10% increase in half the time. Furthermore, when examining the category’s sales relative to the entire car category, the category represented a modest 2% of total sales on average from January 2022 to October 2022. However, from November 2022 to March 2023, it ascended to 5%.\n",
            "In the absence of disaggregated sales figures, one could surmise that the surge in sales was due to the BR-V overshadowing the HR-V in terms of general interest. Yet, a cursory glance at Google Trends reveals that the HR-V has consistently piqued more interest than the BR-V for the majority of the time from September of the previous year until now, with the HR-V only recently descending to interest levels comparable to the BR-V. This is where our problem lies, and the second part of our story begins.\n",
            "While the HR-V made a spectacular debut, it appears to have lost its initial momentum. In terms of nominal sales, sales relative to the entire car market, and sales relative to Honda’s portfolio alone, the aforementioned dual category has experienced a significant downturn. The HR-V and BR-V category, based on PAMA’s sales figures until September of this year, is actually trailing the average sales for the category from September 2019 to date. This trend has been evident since February 2023.\n",
            "Nominal figures might be deceptive, given the current turbulence in the automotive industry, but the narrative remains consistent in terms of relative sales to the overall car market. The category has only once surpassed its five-year average since February 2023, with it lagging behind said average for several months as well. To ensure a comprehensive analysis, we also investigated whether the HR-V was trading at a premium or a discount in the secondary market.\n",
            "As most Pakistani automotive buyers would be  aware, there’s an alternative barometer of market interest: the elusive ‘on-premium’. This term refers to the additional sum a customer willingly parts with, over and above the ex-factory price of a vehicle, to secure their coveted car on the very same day, thereby circumventing the agonising wait of months for delivery. The reason for this delay is that Pakistani automotive companies only produce the car after getting an order for it.\n",
            "The HR-V retails for between Rs 76.5 lakh to Rs 79 lakh based on which of the two variants you get. However, here’s where the on-premium comes back in. Like all other cars, the HR-V does not retail for the listed price. And unlike most other vehicles, it does not benefit from the secondary market’s markup being in it’s favour. If anything, consumers, currently, think it migh be overpriced. What do we mean? \n",
            "To find out the premium for the HR-V, we drew comparisons with other vehicles that could potentially serve as substitutes. Our selection criteria included vehicles that were either Rs 5 lakh cheaper or more expensive than the HR-V Vti and the HR-V Vti-S, respectively. These included the Corolla Altis special edition, the Corolla Grande with beige or black interiors, Hyundai’s Tucson GLS and GLS Sport, KIA’s Sportage Alpha and Sportage FWD, Haval’s Jolion, Peaugeot’s Allure 2008, MG’s HS, and Changan’s Oshan X7. We examined a total of 309 vehicles across the 13 models, giving each model a sample size of 25 where possible.\n",
            "Out of the 13 vehicles, 8 traded at higher prices than their original ones. However, the HR-V models were not among them.\n",
            "So, what led to the dismal situation of Honda’s HR-V?\n",
            "“In my opinion, the HR-V was launched as a half-baked product,” declares Shaheel Shahzad, Co-founder of Bloombig Overdrive. “Chinese automakers provide more features such as driver assistance and panoramic sunroofs. In contrast, Honda has failed to equip the HR-V with even basic amenities like cruise control or a sunroof. Not to mention, but the 1.5L naturally aspirated engine is sluggish” Shahzad expounds.\n",
            "When it comes to features, Shahzad’s argument holds water. A comparison of the HR-V with its potential rivals reveals that the HR-V Vti is second from the bottom, while the HR-V Vti-S is fourth from the bottom in terms of features across the range of vehicles. The only two vehicles that the HR-V manages to surpass — the Corolla Altis special edition  and Hyundai Tucson GLS — are not only more economical but also larger in the case of the latter.\n",
            "The HR-V’s shortcomings become glaringly apparent when we focus solely on the C-SUV segment. “The Sportage Alpha, with its cruise control, larger engine, and cabin size, is a better option in my view,” Shahzad adds. Although the HR-V’s only real competitor based on size alone is the Peugeot 2008, the HR-V is, on average, pricier than the Peugeot and sits squarely in the middle of C-segment C-SUVs across the board. This point is pivotal because while the difference in features is essentially an indictment against the HR-V, the size difference is of greater significance. It is perhaps the catalyst for the C-SUV market’s initial success.\n",
            "This publication has previously discussed how the dimensions and pricing of KIA’s Sportage—and its peers—have chipped away at the traditional sedan market.\n",
            "Read more:\n",
            " Can KIA be King, or do the Big 3 have another trick up their sleeve?\n",
            "The heart of the issue is that Pakistani customers have a preference for larger vehicles. While the HR-V is larger than some of the sedans it competes against, it is no longer the only player in the game. “The HR-V’s price range now offers a multitude of options. This is a stark contrast to the market in 2016 when the BR-V launched as the only locally manufactured seven-seater vehicle. Even if these competing vehicles only sell a few hundred units per model, it adds up. That’s market share being wrested away from Honda,” explicates Usman Ansari, Founder of CarSpiritPK.\n",
            "However, Honda’s predicament may not be unique to Pakistan, at least according to Ansari. “On a global scale, the Japanese have been slow to respond to the C-SUV market. In stark contrast, the Europeans and Chinese have capitalised on it. As a result, while the Japanese have a smattering of models, the others have a veritable arsenal,” Ansari asserts. \n",
            "An ostensibly straightforward solution for Honda to bolster its market presence could be to either slash the price of the vehicle or amplify its features. However, these alternatives are not as unambiguous as they appear. Trimming prices in Pakistan’s automotive market solely for the sake of sales is a venture fraught with risk. Your vehicle could emulate either the trajectory of the KIA Sorento or the Peugeot 2008. There’s an absence of certainty, and the hazards of having the former’s fate in your portfolio are something any car manufacturer would shudder at. As for augmenting features, they might merely inflate the cost and aggravate the predicament.\n",
            "The quandary Honda faces bears a striking resemblance to the conundrum it grappled with from 2016 to 2018 with the predecessor of the HR-V. The only divergence is that the stakes have been raised this time around. Unlike in 2016, Honda has now ventured to manufacture the vehicle on Pakistani soil. Consequently, it has invested billions in the hope of the car’s success. This bold move comes at a time when every automotive titan has resolved to conquer the C-SUV market.\n",
            "This is not to insinuate that Honda is oblivious to its challenges. The unexpected offering of 24-month interest-free instalments provides the company with an ingenious method of reducing prices without enduring the Sorento debacle themselves. However, if Honda has any trump card hidden up its sleeve, it might need to make its move sooner rather than later. \n",

            "M, however, seems to have internalised this scheme of things. When asked whether he felt exploited by the partners at the firm, he defended them, by saying they were kind to him. An example of the aforementioned kindness? His water geyser broke down last week, which he obviously couldn’t pay to fix. “So the seniors let me shower at the office.”\n",
            " \n",
            "The eminence of wage exploitation in law firms became a prominent topic of discussion earlier last month when junior associates and lawyers began revealing the disproportionate nature of their remunerations at leading law firms on social media. Quoting an average of 10 hour work days, sometimes seven days a week, junior associates said they were barely paid minimum wage for their contributions.\n",
            "This piece is about the wages at leading law firms in the country and not the single-lawyer small outfits which form the bulk of the manner in which law is practiced in the country. It is necessary to point out that the term “leading law firm” is not used loosely but refers, throughout this piece, to the category of Pakistani law firms with international accreditations and rankings on the Legal500 and on the Chambers and Partners. \n",

            "almost exploitative\n",
            " underpayments. For instance, according to Abdul Moiz Jaferii, senior partner at HWP Law, junior lawyers are underpaid because law firms simply can not afford to pay them. According to Waqqas Mir,  senior partner at Axis Law Chamber, the nature of exposure and learning provided by firms compensates for the absence of a minimum wage. To a senior associate at ABS, the nature of payments received poses logistical restraints to payments. And to Feisal Naqvi, senior partner at Bhandari Naqvi Riaz (BNR), the cyclical payments and inexperience of junior lawyers made them difficult to reward, as written in his article, \n",
            "“Lawyering and its discontents”.\n",
            " \n",
            "Overall, Profit recognized three overarching categories of reasonings: the size of the market for legal services in Pakistan, the nature of payments and unaffordability, and the inexperience and inefficiency of junior lawyers. In line with the legal industry’s embedded culture of seniority, we will begin by verifying these reasonings first. \n",
            "Intuitively, this makes sense. Consider not only the costs and inefficiencies associated with the country’s judicial system but also the alternative avenues available for conflict resolution. A large majority of the cases filed in court, from civil litigation matters of land grabbing, to corporate cases of financial transactions can be resolved or achieved through either implicit payments to third parties or through out of court arbitration, amongst other ways. \n",
            "This, according to some members of the legal fraternity, means that not only are legal services undervalued but there are also very few people and organizations willing to take the legal route and pay for the service. Therefore, since the size of the pie is small to begin with, the portion cut out for junior lawyers has to be even smaller. \n",
            "However, Profit did a small exercise to assess if the legal services market is actually as miniscule as is famously insinuated. The financial reports of five top companies listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange, namely: \n",
            "Fauji Fertilizer, Habib Bank, Mari Petroleum, Millat Tractors, and Indus Motors reveal an aggregate of Rs 1.6 billion spent on legal and accounting services. Even if we were to assume that half of this amount spent by these five companies is spent on accounting and audit reports, the remainder is still a substantial figure of around Rs 844 million for only five companies – which does not necessarily make for a small pie. \n",
            "There are some caveats to this approach, most prominently that this ballpark figure does not reveal whether the Rs 844 million is being paid to one, five, or twenty law firms. Instead, this exercise only helps encapsulate the overall size of demand for legal services. As law firms have numerous branches of legal practice and specialization, it is common for businesses to hire more than one law firm for their tasks. Resultantly, the amount of money a company pays for legal service does not necessarily equal the amount of money a particular firm earns.\n",
            "It is imperative to note that in his conversation with Profit, Jaferii clarified that unaffordability stemmed from the nature of payments and not the overall amount received. He explained, “law firms receive cyclical payments instead of constant payments, as pointed out by Feisal Naqvi as a result of which attempts to keep overheads as low as possible need to be made.”\n",
            "Naqvi elaborates on this in his article as well. Apparently, the litigation fees paid to law firms in Pakistan are paid on a lump-sum basis, meaning that the entire payment is received before the case begins and therefore, as the overhead costs increase, the amount taken home by the senior counsel decreases. It would be a fair assumption to make that these lump-sum payments that Naqvi was referring to were specific to the business model of his own law firm, BNR. But that is not necessarily the case. \n",
            "Trying to understand all the income streams of law firms is like playing with a \n",
            "Matryoshka doll. The lump sum and cyclical payments referred to above, therefore, are only one of the many wooden dolls in a very extensive stack. Lets look specifically at Naqvi’s firm. To assume BNR is potentially unable to fairly compensate its junior lawyers because they are not recipients of an unimpeded revenue stream is not only an incorrect statement, but also one that is unfair. \n",
            "This is where we introduce you to a retainer agreement. \n",
            "A retainer agreement is a work-for-hire contract wherein an advanced retainer fee is paid by a client to a service providing firm to reserve their services for any future requirements. This means that not only is it paid on a monthly basis, but it is also paid regardless of if any work is carried out by the firm and without the firm sustaining any overhead costs. Interestingly, not only does Naqvi’s law firm BNR have a retainer agreement, but more importantly, they have it with META, formerly known as Facebook Inc, with a fixed monthly income of approximately Rs 1.5 crore. \n",
            "Additionally, senior partners at law firms are also advocates of the Supreme and High courts of Pakistan, which command high representation and consultation fees. Profit was able to quantify and specify the amounts by reaching out to some clients who had hired such lawyers for either their Supreme or High court cases. Resultantly we found that in 2020, a very popular senior advocate charged a minimum fees of Rs 50 lakhs, a figure that is likely to have increased substantially since, while a former attorney general’s minimum fees is currently set between Rs 1.5 to 2 crore per case. According to BNR’s secretary, the hourly consultation fees for the firm’s senior partners – Feisal Naqvi, Uzair Bhandari, and Iftikharuddin Riaz –  is set at a minimum of Rs 50,000 per hour for a fresh case of arbitration at the civil court. \n",
            "Moreover, when Profit spoke with over 10 junior lawyers currently working at Pakistan’s leading law firms, they all disagreed with the claim that their low salaries were associated with the problem of  high costs and low revenues. One of them explained why he believed there was a disproportionate relationship between the inflow and outflow of cash at his firm. “My firm quotes $ 250 USD (Rs 69,218) \n",
            "yes, you read it right,\n",
            " to foreign clients for us junior lawyers working on the project. We don’t even get paid Rs 69,000 \n",
            "per month\n",
            " let alone \n",
            "per hour\n",
            ", so where does that money go?”. \n",
            "Lets build on this information. If one of these top law firms has three senior partners, each of whom take up a minimum of two Supreme court cases per year, even this could guarantee a minimum baseline figure of Rs 1 crore coming into the firm. Additionally, if that firm also has a retainer agreement, that guarantees a fixed monthly revenue without any simultaneous costs. Foreign clients such as \n",
            "the World Bank Group, International Finance Corporation, and Saudi National Bank –  all of whom work with Haidermota & Co Advocates – are not only likely to pay a fees higher than Pakistani clients, but are also receptive to hourly billable charges as was revealed by the junior lawyer. \n",
            "The absence of verified, exact figures is due to the fact that the law firms we are investigating are private entities who are not required to disclose their financial statements. This makes it difficult to assess precisely the gap between what senior and junior lawyers make, as data remains primarily anecdotal. Salman Ijaz, from the law firm KhanIjaz refers to this as the culture of secrecy within the legal profession, explaining that it’s normal for lawyers working together to be unaware of each other’s monthly take home salary. \n",
            "However, conclusively, this problem highlighted by both Jaferii and Naqvi seems to be a very simple oversight in the business model law firms follow. Even if we were to assume that the only inflow of money in law firms was through cyclical lump sum payments, following a cost-plus model wherein the s\n",
            "elling price of a product is determined by adding a specific fixed percentage or markup to the product’s unit cost could solve the issue of unaffordability\n",
            ". \n",
            "Perhaps hiring a financial analyst or accountant could help achieve this, but that would be an ironic recommendation to make while investigating the case of underpayment and exploitation of employees at these firms. \n",
            "In his conversation with Profit, Ijaz explained why he believed that this alleged inexperience of junior lawyers could not be responsible for the skew in law firm salaries. Ijaz confirmed there is a plethora of different types of tasks carried out by junior lawyers when they first begin working, from less skill based work like arranging files and securing a court date from the judge, to more skill based work like legal research and writing. In both cases, he explained, junior lawyers must at least be paid minimum wage– Rs 32,000, without question. \n",
            "Jaferii claims that something similar must be reintroduced, like an apprenticeship where, unlike a formal employment contract, junior lawyers receive a fixed monthly stipend. This could help bridge the gap between their theoretical learnings at law school and the real legal practice in the industry. \n",
            "However, Ijaz’s support for such a scheme was layered in skepticism over its potential to be exploited with students working full time as apprentices without any wages. He recommended strict regulation. \n",
            "According to Mir, he worried that imposing a minimum wage would create structural unemployment in the more widespread practices like the law chambers. instead the wage flooring should be set according to the law firm’s market size. This means that the wages paid should be reflective of the proportion of the market that the law firm leverages. \n",
            "Moreover, in his comments to Profit, Dr. Ikram Ul Haq, Advocate Supreme Court and Partner at Huzaima Ikram and Ijaz, had a few bones to pick with the Pakistan Bar Council and the Senior Partners in question. According to Haq, “If the problem of inefficient junior lawyers is so widespread, then a structural change within the profession needs to happen where law firms provide internships to enrolled law students to make sure they have experience before they graduate.” He further added that the legal industry should look towards the structure of chartered accountancy in Pakistan, but the Bar Council’s sole concern is raging politics and creating more lawyers who can partake in vandalism during the riots and marches mandated by the council. \n",
            "A firm, in business terms, is an enterprise or company that is widely associated with a partnership model. On the other hand, a corporation is a company or organization that is authorized to act as a single business entity. A corporate structure, therefore, \n",
            "consists of various departments that all contribute to the company’s overall mission.\n",
            "As an overarching solution to the presence of exploitation and underpayment in law firms, Haq suggested that an adaptation of a corporate structure has become integral in Pakistan’s legal industry– particularly in its law firms. The notion of law being a one man show must end in order for junior lawyers to be paid what they deserve, because as of now, Senior partners believe they run the show because that is how people have made them to feel. “These big lawyers want no change either. They know law is a service based on face-value and so even if they (lawyers) take 10 cases a year they can make up to Rs 10 crore, some of which is given to their clerks, some to cover fixed costs, some to junior lawyers, and a majority to themselves.” \n",
            "A corporate structure prevents this from happening as it recognizes the designated work for each department and allots remunerations accordingly. However, since this would also prevent partners from taking home the bulk of the money, it is unfortunately overlooked. \n",
            "When Profit spoke to Mir, for instance, he expounded that the debate was elitist and that elite law firms made up a very small proportion of legal services in Pakistan. For Mir, complaints made by junior lawyers about getting paid Rs 40,000 per month stemmed from sheer privilege that needs to be revisited. \n",
            "When asked about the absence of a set career trajectory at law firms that would help junior lawyers manage their wage expectations, Jaferii stated, “Yes there’s a lot of conversation that needs to happen in the legal profession but a lot of it is far more important than a young lawyer’s career trajectory. We must discuss that there is a consequence to lying in court, a consequence to delaying cases for years…”\n",
            "While the claims of both Mir and Jaferri are important, to categorize this debate as insignificant because law firms are a niche practice or that the junior lawyers in question come from a particular socio-economic class is inequitable. To put it in legal terms, it sets a terrible precedent of exploitation amongst the top of the legal profession hierarchy, which normalizes the culture of underpayment in the rest of the industry. \n",
            "Ijaz surveyed 139 respondents to gather the remuneration figures at over 40 of Pakistan’s leading law firms. The data is compiled in this \n",
            "spreadsheet\n",
            " and it largely confirms the claims of wage exploitation.\n",
            "Let’s be clear. The term wage exploitation does not simply mean a junior is not paid according to what he/she deems sufficient, rather it is used in comparison to the minimum wage set for unskilled workers released by the Employment Federation of Pakistan.\n",
            "Profit reached out to Naqvi for clarifications on the matter of the applicability of the minimum wage in the legal industry. Naqvi replied stating “The short answer (to this question) is that I do not know… I do not know if the minimum wage applied to lawyers. And assuming it does apply, I am not sure how other lawyers justify paying less than minimum wage.” He was further able to confirm that BNR now offers starting lawyers Rs. 40,000 and above. \n",
            "In his comments to Profit, however, Salaar Khan, associate partner at AJURIS, explained that the absence of a minimum wage was just the tip of the iceberg. According to Khan, many regulations, such as the Provincial Shops and Establishment Ordinances and Acts which provide for how long a work week must be, the rules around sick leaves and so on are also not applied to law firms despite their applicability. He explained that the problem was fundamentally of a disinterest in enforcing these regulations, including the minimum wage, as is depicted in the informal nature of employment in law firms where sometimes even a formal contract is not used for junior associates and also in the absence of any supervision by the Bar Council– which as Khan explained, under the Legal Practitioners Act does have some responsibilities in this entire matter. \n",
            "The truth is, \n",
            "that the irony of hiring a law firm for matters of labour exploitation would be glaring unless these practices are improved. As of now, legal practice in Pakistan remains exclusive and inaccessible to women across all socio-economic backgrounds owing to its deeply patriarchal structure. Further barriers to entry imposed by the absence of a minimum wage or fair remuneration only make matters worse and lessen the already few opportunities available to young Pakistanis for upward financial mobility. \n",
            "Conclusively, although law firms are privately owned entities, a unanimous recognition of the merits of introducing transparency in their financial structures would aid great improvements in the ecosystem. Haq’s comments on moving towards a corporate structure is one way to achieve this, but greater regularization of the legal fees and maintaining the sanctity of the contract could also be helpful steps in the right direction. \n",

            "A brief note on the data and methodology used in this article. The data comes from the State Bank of Pakistan’s quarterly and annual Payment Systems Review reports from the third quarter of calendar year 2016 through the second quarter of calendar year 2023. The reports extend much further back into the past as well, but the data appears to be compiled using a different methodology in prior years, and we included only data from the years where it seemed most directly comparable. Unless we specify otherwise, all growth rates mentioned in this article refer to the total value of transactions, not volume.\n",
            "We also felt this was the most pertinent period to examine, since this is also the time when Pakistanis began to gain access to the internet in large numbers, following the auction of the 3G and 4G mobile broadband internet spectrum, which gave tens of millions of Pakistanis access to the internet for the first time.\n",
            "Profit\n",
            " has not just compiled the data, but also combined it with other banking sector data to create as holistic a picture of payments in Pakistan as possible.\n",
            "While the data for every other payment method is available in that report, what is not available is the volume of cash transactions that do not touch the banking system at either end (i.e. neither the giver nor the receiver of the cash is a banking or financial entity). While the volume of cash transactions is not directly measured by the State Bank of Pakistan, because it issues bank notes, it has a fairly good idea of exactly how much physical cash is in circulation at any given moment in time.\n",
            "We made a simplifying assumption that the velocity of transactions involving physical cash is approximately the same as that involving the payments system in any given period. We are not certain as to how accurate this assumption is likely to be, but we also do not have a better number to go on.\n",
            "Having calculated the total value of transactions involving cash, we then subtract from that the value of cash transactions involving the banks (ATM or branch withdrawals and deposits) to arrive at an estimate of the size of the cash-only transactions economy. This estimate is then plugged into any calculations involving market share of cash vs electronic payments.\n",
            "One other note: we excluded interbank settlements and government bond transactions in our analysis, since those are transactions that are needed to keep the payments and banking system running. Counting them would likely end up double-counting many transactions and hence result in a skewed picture of what people are actually using to make their payments.\n",
            "One final bit: we are putting in US dollar equivalents for many numbers in this story to help illustrate the scale of what we are talking about. Since almost all of the numbers involved represent flows over a period of time, we will adopt the convention of utilising the average exchange rate during that period, defined as the midpoint of the open market buying and selling exchange rates as published by Business Recorder.\n",
            "Take a look at where the current state of payments is in Pakistan, and you will notice the absolute dominance of cash. About 37.2% of transactions are cash-only – meaning they do not interact with the banking system on either the payer or receiver side. Another 11.8% are deposits and withdrawals from bank branches, and a further 1.6% are withdrawals and deposits at ATMs. All told, the total amount of transactions involving physical cash is about 50.7% of the value of all transactions in the country.\n",
            "Indeed, purely electronic transactions account for just 15.9% of the value of all transactions in the country. (The bulk of the remainder is taken up by things like cheques, and other paper instruments.) But take a look at the growth rates and it becomes clear that growth in payments is coming largely from electronic payment methods, with cash and paper slowly but surely losing ground.\n",
            "On the chart of the growth rates in payment value by payment type, all of the top five spots are taken up by internet-based methods.\n",
            "Bank mobile apps are the fastest-growing, with the total value of mobile app transactions growing by an average of 135% per year since 2016. It is getting to the point where bank apps are no longer just a niche that is posting high growth rates purely due to a low-base effect. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023, transactions initiated on mobile apps reached Rs23.7 trillion ($92.7 billion) in value. That means that every month, there are nearly Rs2 trillion ($7.7 billion) worth of transactions taking place, mostly at the beginning of the month, just off people’s mobile phones.\n",
            "Transactions on the desktop websites of banks – which were a larger market than mobile apps as recently as the second quarter of 2021 – are the second-fastest growing, at an average rate of about 60% per year since 2016.\n",
            "Bank websites and mobile apps are now rapidly becoming a favoured method by which Pakistanis transact. In the second quarter of 2023, the most recent period for which data is available, transactions worth Rs12.4 trillion ($40.7 billion) took place on bank websites and mobile apps. During that same period, total cash withdrawals from both bank branches and ATMs were only slightly higher, at about Rs 14.5 trillion ($49 billion). If current growth rates hold, we suspect that cash withdrawals from banks will be smaller than bank mobile and website transactions within the current quarter, and almost certainly by the end of the current fiscal year.\n",
            "In some categories, consumers’ desire to transact online is quite high. For instance, about 48% of all utility bills in Pakistan by value were paid during the second quarter of 2023 on a bank website or a mobile app. That number was less than 4% in 2017.\n",
            "Card-based e-commerce – i.e. NOT cash on delivery – is growing at 57% per year, the electronic large retail and B2B transactions system at 35%, and physical card transactions at a point-of-sale (POS) machine at 28% per year.\n",
            "The relative magnitude of these growth rates, and which ones are higher and lower tells us a lot about the state of mind of the Pakistani consumer, and what strategies might be applied for businesses that want to take advantage of this.\n",
            " \n",
            "I made my first e-commerce purchase in Pakistan in 2009, when I bought a book on the Liberty Books website and paid with a debit card. At the time, virtually everyone I knew told me I was stupid and that my card information would be leaked and my money would be stolen. That kind of thing does, of course, happen, but it did not happen to me.\n",
            "Those kinds of concerns have largely receded into the background today. People still have a strong preference for cash-on-delivery, but it is not because they fear putting their card information into a website. They may be sceptical of merchants, but they trust the payments system, and for that, we must give the banks credit.\n",
            "Pakistan is nowhere near where it needs to be in terms of availability and ease of electronic payments, but there is no denying that the progress has been impressive over the past five years. In a previous story on the subject, we mentioned the fact that the prevalence of 3G and 4G internet was a massive enabling factor in the rise of electronic payments.\n",
            "We must add that both the State Bank of Pakistan and the banks have done a good job. The banks, pushed both by the State Bank and the payment networks (Visa and Mastercard), have helped the public gain trust in using cards online, in shops, and on ATMs. They have built largely secure websites and apps that – while being less than stellar in performance sometimes – are products that people feel they can trust to do the job well and, most importantly, not let their money get stolen.\n",
            "This is not, in any way, to suggest that fraud does not happen or that hacks are not a concern. They are, but they have become rare enough that the public at large is not too frightened to use electronic means of transacting, and for that, the banks, the payment networks, and the central bank deserve credit.\n",
            "And the fact that card-based e-commerce is also growing rapidly – albeit less rapidly than bank apps and websites – suggests that the horror stories of e-commerce notwithstanding, people are a bit more willing to trust e-commerce merchants than meets the eye.\n",
            "One hypothesis that some people have put forward: people will pay cash-on-delivery for the first, or first few, orders from an e-commerce merchant. But once they establish trust, they will then place subsequent transactions using a debit or credit card.\n",
            "Talk to e-commerce merchants and most insist that cash-on-delivery accounts for between 80-90% of their business, and for some it is even higher. We have no reason to believe this is not the case, but the fact that Pakistanis spent $564 million in fiscal year 2023 through their cards on Pakistani e-commerce websites and apps – and that this number has been growing at an average of 57% per year for the past 6 years – tells us that card-based e-commerce is not just a curiosity. People clearly wish they could trust e-commerce websites enough to use cards as their default payment method.\n",
            "So how do we reconcile both of these data points: card-based payments are growing rapidly, but merchants say the proportion of their revenue coming from cash-on-delivery is about the same as it was in 2016. Only one explanation makes sense: e-commerce as a category is growing by that rapid rate.\n",
            "An interesting question to which we tried to get an answer but have not yet found one: how much of this growth is coming from new users trying out e-commerce for the first time vs expanded spending by existing e-commerce customers? If we find data that answers that question, we will report back.\n",
            "And after years of stalled growth, there now appears to be a sharp increase in transaction value for card payments at retail outlets. POS transactions were a relatively slow growing category between 2016 and 2020, but over the past three years have averaged about 54% annual growth.\n",
            "What caused the sudden change? The number of POS machines. As of September 30, 2020, there were just shy of 53,000 POS machines deployed across all of Pakistan, a number that had grown at an embarrassing 1.2% per year for the previous four years. As of June 30 of this year, that number has more than doubled to 115,000 POS machines.\n",
            "Intensifying competition amongst the banks and payments companies appears to be behind this increase, though the number of banks that offer POS machines – nine – has not changed during this period.\n",
            "In short, this data is telling us that people in Pakistan largely trust the payment rails that help them transact electronically. When those rails are made more accessible, they will use them. They only pause when they do not trust the person on the other end of the transaction.\n",
            " \n",
            "So if you are a bank CEO or a startup founder, what should you take away from this? How can you take advantage of what is clearly the mother of all economic behavioural changes taking place in Pakistan today?\n",
            "In our view, the answer is simple (even if its implications are complex): any business that is able to increase trust between transacting parties will build a winning business. This can take many forms, whether it be a high-service-quality e-commerce merchant, or a marketplace that insists on performing verifications of every merchant it allows onto its platform.\n",
            "Or it could look like Safepay’s recurring payment feature.\n",
            "To recall, Safepay is one of Pakistan’s leading fintech startups focused on enabling e-commerce merchants to accept electronic payments, and after spending at least two years working on it, they have finally been able to launch their recurring payment feature. It could, if used right, be a game-changer for Pakistan’s economy.\n",
            "Why? Because it reduces the barriers to trust between any two transacting parties. By allowing the buyer to break up the payment they owe the seller into multiple smaller payments, each of which is automatically authorised when they set up the first payment, they are reducing the risk each party is taking on in transacting with the other.\n",
            "The number of businesses that can be built on top of this is simply astounding. Here is a partial list of things that could potentially be built using this feature from Safepay. (Note to aspiring founders: some of these are startup ideas.)\n",
            "Rental payments: A web portal that allows landlords to collect rent from their tenants on a monthly basis rather than insisting on annual rent being paid up front, which many prospective tenants find difficult. By making monthly payments the norm, the size of the population that can consider renting their own place would increase, which would reduce the vacancy rates on rental properties.\n",
            "Insurance: Instead of having to pay annual premiums, insurance company clients could pay monthly premiums, which would increase the market size by allowing more people to try out insurance.\n",
            "BNPL: Buy-now-pay-later companies can substantially reduce their risk by allowing users to enter recurring payment authorizations on their debit cards, which would lower at least some of the default risk.\n",
            "Services professionals’ fees: Imagine being able to pay a lawyer, an accountant, or an advertising agency their fees in smaller instalments, all authorised as recurring payments on a debit card. Payments for such services would feel more manageable, more people and businesses would feel they could afford them, and the service professionals in these fields which are notorious for low pay that often comes late will find higher and more predictable cash flows.\n",
            "Notice one thing the above list has in common: all of these are services and products that currently exist but are accessible only to a small number of buyers, and the sellers find their selling experience highly unpleasant since there are so many trust issues.\n",
            "Lowering the lump sum costs by breaking them up into predictable, automated monthly payments would increase trust. (Remember: lump sum payments are often the result of low trust to begin with. For example, in the case of annual rents for real estate.) It also, quite obviously, makes costs more manageable without necessarily decreasing them, thereby increasing market size.\n",
            "And if banks were to allow recurring payments from bank accounts – and thereby avoid the 2.9% debit card fees – some more use cases would open up.\n",
            "Automated car loan and mortgage repayments: Banks could reduce a significant portion of their repayment risks on car loans and mortgages if they stopped resisting the attempts by 1Link and others to implement a recurring payment feature in bank accounts. It would open up their lending book to all banking customers, instead of just the customers of their banks, and in turn would increase their ability to grow these business lines.\n",
            "Systematic investment plans: This would allow people to deposit money into mutual fund or brokerage accounts at a regular cadence, allowing them to systematically invest their money and ensure that they could build up wealth for themselves and their families.\n",

            "What do you do when you’re a company that needs a loan? The obvious answer might be going to a bank and applying for one. But if your company is part of a larger group of companies there might be a simpler option available to you. \n",
            "Take the case of Saif Textile Mills. The mill is part of the Saif Group and when it needed a loan instead of approaching a bank they went to an entity by the name of Saif Holding Limited — an associated company that is also part of the Saif Group. Saif Holding gave a loan facility of upto Rs 77 crores to Saif Textile Mills in the past. Except the loan wasn’t being given free of consideration or with a payment plan. The loan was a running finance facility and had to be paid back to Saif Holdings with interest. Now the mill feels that it can pay off the past loan with issuing shares in the name of Saif Holding Limited. This is what is known in the finance world as a loan-to-equity swap. \n",
            "The loan that was given to Saif Textiles was for working capital requirements. The loan was given till 31st December 2023. For the last few years, the company has been making losses. This creates pressure on its assets and ability to pay back its loan. As the company was suffering losses, the best option for the company was to secure a short term loan from a bank, get extension or restructuring of this debt or to give out equity in exchange. \n",
            "Saif has announced that they will take the third option. \n",
            "The company is basically printing shares and giving them to another company as a compensation for the loan that they have been given. But since both companies are part of the same larger group, it shouldn’t be an issue, right? The only problem is that while the two companies are associated they are still entirely separate entities. That means the shareholders of the textile mill are investing in a different company from the shareholders in the holding company. As a result, some shareholders are not pleased with the deal because it means the rights and the holdings of the shareholders are being diluted. But is it as big of a deal as it is being made out to be? \n",
            "Article continues after this advertisement\n",
            "Saif Textile Mills is a publicly listed company. Up until recently 49.58% of shareholding in the company was held by the Saif Holding Company. As an associated company this isn’t particularly strange. But overall the textile mill is an entirely different entity with its own investors and books.\n",
            "But as the company is part of the Saif Group, they had secured a running credit facility with Saif Holdings, an associate company, that could go up to Rs. 77 crores given at mark-up at the rate of average local borrowing cost of lender + 0.1% spread. The loan was to be paid off by December 31 2023. From this facility, till date, it has used around Rs. 60 crores. On the 2nd November this year, Saif Textiles communicated to the stock exchange that it was converting the loan of Rs. 60 crores that it had secured from Saif Holding and converting this into equity. It would do so by issuing Saif Holdings an additional 6 crore shares at a par value of Rs. 10 each which would be equal to the loan that had been given to it. The company would give the associate company the shares and the loan would be considered settled.\n",
            "Now let’s look at this in a little more detail. The company currently has a free float of 50% which means these shares are held by investors who are not associated with the company.  Increasing issued shares from 26.4 million to 86.4 million with all of the shares going to the Saif Holding will tilt the bulk of the shareholding towards the associated company. The shareholding of Saif Holding alone will stand at 84% in the new company while the other shareholders will have 16% of the shareholding where earlier they held 50% of the shareholder.\n",
            "As a result, the book value per share of the shareholders will go from Rs. 151.9 per share as it stands today to Rs. 53.4 per share which can be seen as a destruction of 65% net worth of investors with the single stroke of a pen. Book value is the value of the company after its liabilities are deducted from its assets as declared in their financial statements. The logic is that if the company were to sell off its assets and pay off its creditors, what is the amount that will be available to be distributed to its shareholders.\n",
            "The concern that is being raised in the market regarding this issue of shares is due to the notification which had been sent by the company back in January. The notification was a clarification sent by Saif Textiles denying any rumors circulating in the market that Saif Textile Mills was going to be sold. \n",
            "This point becomes pertinent as, if the company was going to be shut, the company would have to sell off its assets and pay off its liabilities. The remaining amount would be paid to the shareholders. That means that the book value of Rs. 151.9 per share would be expected by the shareholders as things stood. Shareholders would buy shares of such a company in order to get a payback of Rs 150 after buying the shares at Rs 10 in the market. \n",
            "According to companies own accounts, Saif Textile Mills has recorded its freehold land in its accounts at Rs. 1 billion while the forced sales value shows that the land is actually worth Rs. 6.6 billion. If this value is used instead of the book value of the asset, the book value of the company actually jumps much further to Rs. 365.6 per share.\n",
            "At this stage, it can be seen that a company which was rumored to be being sold is looking to give out shares to the market. On the face of it, it is clear that shareholders are losing out. In the future, if the company does close down, they would end up getting a lower price for their shares. As the number of shares increase, the book value per share falls leading to a decreased payback. \n",
            "Even if the company feels that the increased interest of the associate company will turn around the fortunes of the company, the company will see depressed earning per share and loss per shares will also fall. At this point it can be seen that shareholders are losing out due to the issue being carried out. If I was an investor, I would feel that in addition to my shareholding being decreased, my stake in the company has decreased and I get a lesser share in the profits of the future aswell. \n",
            "An alternative that can be used is a rights issue which could be much more fair to the investors as they would be allowed to subscribe and invest in the company and this would not deplete their shareholding or book value of the company. The additional funds raised could be used by the company to pay off its debt. The equity increase would be funded by an increase in the assets of the company and the shareholders would still own the same percentage of the company that they held before.\n",
            "Currently the share issue has been sent to the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) which has to approve the resolution being allowed to be passed. \n",
            "At initial glance it doesn’t look too good. Here we have shareholders watching their shareholding diluted and the value of their shares drop drastically. But could this be a case of crying wolf? First of all, let us consider the point of view of an investor who currently holds the shares of the company. \n",
            "Right now, the shares are being traded at Rs. 9.35 per share. This is the most a buyer is willing to pay for my share. In case I feel the company is going to disadvantage me, I can sell my shares for this price. It might seem like I am selling it for a low price but the fact is that Saif Holdings is going to buy the same shares at a higher price of Rs. 10 compared to me. The loan is not being paid off in the amount of pennies per say.\n",
            "Secondly, the book value has been highlighted in many places. It is acceptable that book value is seen to be a good proxy for the actual price for the shares, however, it is not the value at which the company should be valued at. The book value is just a value that is being associated with the assets of a company. The real intrinsic value can only be calculated once the company stops operating and all of its assets are sold. As this company is still operating, no real value can be attached to future earnings, revenues and profitability of the company. The book values do not account for the future operations of the company and that caveat needs to be made here. Relying on just the book value is problematic as it is being seen in isolation.\n",
            "In addition to that, the transaction has been classified as a “share issue other than a rights issue” which means that this is intentionally designed as not being a rights issue. The purpose is not to provide additional shares to the current shareholders or to just the sponsors or associates of the company. This is being used to pay off a debt of an associate company which is seen as a loan-to-equity swap. This is being done to reduce the burden of loan on the company which is beneficial to the shareholders as it decreases the interest payments in the future. This tool is used extensively in the corporate landscape of Pakistan.\n",
            "Now let’s get the SECP involved in this as well. In addition to getting approval from the SECP for the issuance of shares otherwise than right issue, the company needs to “get approval of shareholders through a special resolution for further issue of shares otherwise than rights passed by a majority of not less than three-fourths of such members entitled to vote, as are present in person or by proxy at the general meeting.” This means that Saif Holdings has to get an additional 25% from the free float or minority shareholders in order to get this resolution approved before even being considered by the SECP. The minority shareholders have the power to stop such a move if they feel they are being taken advantage of.\n",
            "It might still be worth looking into just exactly what is being suggested, which is that a rights issue should be carried out. A right issue is a mechanism in which the company asks its current shareholders to subscribe for additional shares. The ones who want to subscribe, pay an additional amount to subscribe for the shares. The ones who do not want to subscribe, can waste these rights. The right shares are also traded in the stock exchange which means an associate company like Saif Holdings can buy these rights from investors willing to sell in the market. \n",
            "The investors who subscribe, retain their shareholding percentage in the company. The ones who sell their rights, see their shareholding fall. The ones who buy the rights in the market get to increase their shareholding. The funds that are raised by the rights issue go to the company which can then use these funds to pay off their debts. \n",
            "The problem with this solution is that it is a roundabout way of doing something simple that can be done with a loan-to-equity swap as well. The company first collects the funds from Saif Holdings and then gives it back to Saif Holdings to pay off its debt. \n",
            "Another problem with this is that the company cannot guarantee that, even after a right issue, the shareholding will stay the same. The investors who do not want to invest more funds in the company will see their shareholding decrease so to expect shareholding percent to stay the same is delusional. \n",
            "Lastly, just like share price falls after dividend or bonus is announced, a right share also leads to a decrease in the market price if additional shares are issued at a discount from the market price. In this case, this would have taken place as well. By issuing shares through a loan-to-equity swap, the share price remains the same. \n",
            "It is good to see that there are hawks sitting in the market who have a keen eye and interest to keep on a look out for injustices and abuses being carried out by the corporate sector in the country. However, in this case, they are seeing an abuse which quite clearly does not exist. On to the next one I presume.\n",
            "While this issue of shares can be protected against due to the high amount of free float held by the market, this does highlight a case where shareholders will see the carpet being pulled from under their feet. And they would not be able to do anything about it. \n",
            "This is a special case where the company has 50 percent shareholding held by investors other than insiders of the company. Due to this, shareholders could and should join together in order to stop any abuse from being carried out. What about cases where less than 25 percent is held by other or minority shareholders?\n",
            "In such a case, the share issue will pass the threshold set by SECP, have the backing of the shareholders and the only recours left would be to file a court case against such an alleged abuse. \n",
            "Companies can even abuse such a law to decrease the shareholding of minority shareholders by taking a loan with the intention of never paying it back, show losses for a few years and then float the idea of a swap. In that case, all these rationale can be used to dilute shareholders value and worth.\n",

            "On October 18, in a surprising turn of events, the CEO of U Microfinance Bank (Ubank) Kabeer Naqvi, decided to resign. Naqvi had been steering the ship at Ubank since 2015, serving as both president and CEO.\n",
            "Just a day later on October 19, Mohamed Essa Al Taheri was announced as the acting president and CEO of UBank, according to a press release by the bank, Al Taheri has been associated with Ubank as a member of the board of directors. \n",
            "With the leadership shift at UBank, a wave of online rumours and speculations surged regarding the financial stability of both UBank and UPaisa. Whispers grew louder, suggesting that their capital reserves were perilously teetering on the brink of negativity. The situation escalated so rapidly that a buzz swept through the digital realm, urging depositors to pull their funds from UBank. Immediately after, PTCL group, the parent company of UBank and UBank itself addressed the ongoing speculations through \n",

            ", calling the claims baseless and unfounded. \n",
            "But who exactly are these depositors? Let’s find out.\n",
            "Under Kabeer Naqvi’s leadership, Ubank had a unique strategy for boosting its deposits. The focus was primarily on institutional deposits, with the top five depositors contributing a whopping 38% of the total deposits, and the top 10 accounting for nearly half. \n",
            "Article continues after this advertisement\n",
            "In addition, the deposits were attracted under a quid pro quo arrangement. These deposits were in a sort of give-and-take arrangement, where any funds received from a financial institution were funnelled right back into the same institution. Furthermore, these deposited funds were heavily concentrated, ranging from 25% to a staggering 77% of the fund’s assets. \n",
            "While the UBank credit rating highlighted the concentration risk, the rating reports of funds do not mention that UBank is the largest investor in these funds.\n",
            "So what was happening?\n",
            "Financial institutions such as Faysal Asset Management, NBP Funds, Allied Bank Limited (ABL) Funds, etc seemed to have discovered a perpetual motion machine to inflate their balance sheet and in turn balance sheet of Ubank as well.\n",
            "In the Profit article “\n",
            "Grow your company size by 3 to 6 times in just months. At least two Pakistani companies have done this & you can too. Here is how\n",
            "”, we hinted that UBank and other financial institutions have discovered a method to inflate their balance sheets. \n",
            "Here’s how that method would work. Let’s say Faysal Asset Management placed a deposit with UBank. UBank essentially used its deposits to purchase money market mutual funds or government securities (T-bills). Then, it pledged those very T-bills to the same banks or even a third-party bank, allowing UBank to borrow additional funds with a small margin. With the borrowed money in hand, UBank repeated the process of purchasing more T-bills. \n",
            "This cycle continued, spinning a web of financial manoeuvring to such a degree that while the size of assets increased from Rs 10,458 crore in 2021 to Rs 22,130 crore in 2022, net assets declined from Rs 749 crore in 2021 to around Rs 709 crore in 2022, a decrease of Rs 40 crore.\n",
            "The result? Ubank’s financial statements grew by three times within a year!\n",
            "But for all of this to happen, Ubank needed deposits. \n",
            "Unlike other big telecom-based microfinance banks, like Telenor Microfinance Bank and Mobilink Microfinance Bank, that had set their sights on branchless banking, U Bank took a more conventional brick-and-mortar strategy. \n",
            "Naqvi had been spearheading an ambitious campaign to open new branches in urban cities like Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad. In a previous interview with Profit in June 2023, Naqvi said, “We did not try to turn it into a telecom company. We said that this is a bank, and its mission is microfinance. Just like a bank, its balance sheet will grow. It will have liquidity, strong cash reserves, a treasury function, Islamic banking, digital banking, and even conventional microfinance. It will also have an urban unit responsible for deposit mobilisation. If all these elements are in place, (only then) will this institution thrive and last for the next hundred years”. These new branches were essentially to bring in low-cost deposits. \n",
            "{Note: Ubank is yet to release its second quarter’s financial statement. The value for Q2 2023’s deposits have been taken from \n",
            "Kabeer Naqvi’s linkedIn post\n",
            " that said that UBank’s deposits have crossed Rs.100 billion}\n",
            "The deposits did increase but the bank mostly attracted high-cost deposits from other banks and firms. \n",
            "This shows that deposits at UBank are not growing organically. This is because these are not sticky retail deposits. The deposits are \n",
            " i.e., from financial institutions that are being used in the perpetual motion machine to inflate the books of both UBank as well as those asset managers.\n",
            "According to the \n",
            "VIS credit report of March 31, 2023\n",
            ", UBank had a high concentration risk. The report said “Concentration risk emanating from deposits portfolio is high as the share of top-50 depositors was significant; moreover, the same is on a higher side in comparison to the majority of industry peers. Top 5 depositors including CDC-Trustee NBP FSIF, CDC Trustee Faysal IGF, DCCL Trustee JS MICR, CDC Trustee HBL and CDC Trustee FAYSAL accounted for 38% (FY21: 29%) of total deposit mix.”\n",
            "“Although overall concentration amongst top deposits is high, comfort is drawn from satisfactory ADR (advance to deposit) ratio and sound long-standing customer relations with the major depositors. The decline in related parties’ deposits proportion to 7.0% (FY21: 10.5%) further adds to the withdrawal risk faced by the Bank. In addition, the proportion of institutional deposits is also sizable and has increased significantly to 83% (FY21: 46%) at the end of FY22. Therefore, in terms of granularity, Ubank compares unfavourably to other microfinance banks.”\n",
            "Two things to note here:\n",
            "The top five depositors are asset managers NBP Financial Sector Income Fund (NBP FSIF), Faysal Income and Growth Fund (Faysal IGF), JS Microfinance Fund (MICR) followed by the two banks Habib Bank Limited (HBL) and Faysal Bank. They comprise 38% of the Rs 92 billion deposit base, meaning that Rs 35 billion are deposited by these five financial institutions. That would translate into an average of Rs 7 billion per institution.\n",
            "As per the last sentence, institutional depositors comprise 83% of the total deposits, up from 46% a year ago. This is \n",
            " for the perpetual motion machine. While having such institutional deposits may be a cause for celebration for a money market fund or a hedge fund, this is a cause for concern for a microfinance bank. Ubank’s risk profile has gone through the roof.\n",
            "According to the annual report of 2022 of UBank, the microfinance bank had invested Rs 3.8 billion in JS Microfinance Sector Fund and Rs 1.7 billion in JS Islamic Income Fund.\n",
            " \n",
            "The VIS report highlighted that MICR is one of the biggest depositors of UBank. In other words, JS funds are the largest depositors of UBank and UBank is the largest investor in JS Funds. UBank had invested Rs 5 billion in JS’s mutual funds including Rs.3.8 billion in JS Microfinance Sector Fund. In return, JS places the same funds back with UBank becoming one of its largest depositors, according to the VIS report.\n",
            "Interestingly, according to JS funds manager report, JS MICR’s total assets at the end of 2022 were Rs 8.6 billion. This means that UBank’s investment accounted for 44% of the JS Fund. Similarly, Ubank’s investment of Rs 1.7 billion comprises 70% of the assets of JS Islamic Income Fund, as total assets at the end of 2022 for JS Income Fund amounted to Rs 2.6 billion.\n",
            "It appears that UBank is the key sponsor of JS Microfinance and JS Islamic Income fund, financing 44% and 70% of their assets respectively.\n",
            "Similarly, in the 2022 investment, UBank’s largest investment at the end of 2022 was at Faysal IGF, with an investment of Rs 7.2 billion. In other words, Faysal IGF accounted for around one third of Ubank’s total investments in mutual funds. \n",
            "UBank had invested Rs 7 billion in Faysal IGF in Dec 2022 and in return, Faysal is the top five depositor most likely placing the same Rs 7 billion with UBank. That is not all. According to the fund manager report of Faysal IGF, the net assets of IGF are Rs.8.3 billion. At Rs 7.2 billion, UBank’s investment comprises 87% of IGF. At the end of March 2023, the total assets of Faysal  IGF were Rs 9 billion. Assuming an average of Rs 7 billion placed by each of the top depositors, Faysal IGF had placed 78% of its assets with UBank.\n",
            "Can you see the pattern here? Again, Faysal IGF is one of the largest depositors of UBank and in turn, UBank is the largest investor in Faysal IGF.\n",
            "The last two of the top five depositors are HBL and Faysal Bank. Not only is Faysal Asset Management placing deposits with UBank, but Faysal Bank is also placing deposits with it. \n",
            "We do not know what UBank is using these funds for, but it would be safe to assume that the relationship would be circular. Why would NBP, HBL, and Faysal place deposits with UBank unless there is some quid pro quo arrangement?\n",
            "A senior official from one of the depositors told Profit that UBank was giving better rates than other microfinance banks. “We as asset management companies (AMCs) want to get the best returns for clients. So we give them placements. In return, to safeguard some of the concerns in the micro space (seeing Telenor, Khushali, Finca), UBank gave some deposits as well so that our confidence grows in them.” He further mentioned that extra AUMs also help. This resulted in a win-win for AMC that they get good deposit rates and AUMs and a win-win for UBank that it has enough deposits to lend (above and beyond their deposits back to the AMC) at higher spreads.\n",
            "(Assets under management (AUM) is the total market value of the investments managed by a person or entity on behalf of investors. AUM fluctuates to reflect the flow of money in and out of a fund and the price performance of the assets).\n",
            "The senior official further mentioned that this is a good business model which only fails if you have too many non-performing loans (NPLs), otherwise spreads-wise and higher deposits make for good profits.\n",
            "Profit also reached out to UBank but received no response till the filing. \n",
            "The quid pro quo arrangement between depositors, specifically asset management companies (AMCs) rather than banks, works like this: AMCs deposit their funds with UBank in exchange for favourable interest rates. UBank then utilizes these deposits to purchase units of AMCs, ultimately boosting the Assets Under Management (AUM) for these companies. This setup creates a mutually beneficial scenario.\n",
            "The key advantage here is that if an AMC wishes to withdraw their deposits, it won’t trigger a liquidity crisis for UBank. Why, you might ask? Well, even if UBank faces a temporary liquidity shortage, it can readily liquidate the units it holds from the AMC to meet its liquidity requirements. Consequently, there’s no cause for concern in this situation.\n",
            "However, the situation differs when it comes to traditional banks. Banks typically receive deposits and lend out a substantial portion of these funds. If a large number of depositors suddenly decide to withdraw their money, which is commonly referred to as a bank run, the bank might face liquidity problems because it has lent out a significant portion of the deposited funds.\n",
            "In the case of UBank, the deposits from AMCs would only pose a challenge if UBank had engaged in lending activities. Nevertheless, UBank has taken a prudent approach by safeguarding the deposited funds and not extending loans. Instead, it has chosen to reinvest these funds with AMCs. As a result, generating liquidity isn’t an issue for UBank in these circumstances.\n",
            "It is also important to mention that as per a casual survey conducted by Profit, individual depositors have thus far not encountered any difficulties when withdrawing their deposits from UBank.\n",
            "In a previous conversation with Profit, Naqvi had said that the increased borrowing was due to Ubank’s newly added treasury and corporate finance vertical. Through this vertical, UBank aims to be the first microfinance bank with an active treasury just like commercial banks. “It will provide UBank with arbitrage opportunities,” Naqvi said. The borrowing activities of UBank encompass syndicated loans, bilateral loans, and bonds, with Naqvi referring to it as a “beautiful bouquet”. Initial borrowing was secured against the loan book, while subsequent borrowing was supported by pledged investments, fostering stronger relationships with banks.\n",
            "“I am building relationships with banks. And over time, they will start lending to me against my advances rather than government-backed securities. One or two banks are already comfortable enough with us to start doing this”, Naqvi added.  \n",
            "The VIS credit report also highlighted that while the microfinance bank had a high concentration risk, comfort was sought from “sound long-standing customer relations with the major depositors”.\n",
            "What we have seen is that three of the top five depositors are mutual funds. The placements they have made with UBank appear as cash in Fund Manager Reports and not placement i.e., the asset managers can withdraw the money at short notice. Thus, at the first sign of trouble, these deposits could be withdrawn.\n",
            "With the ongoing speculation about UBank’s equity, there’s a looming possibility that its deposits could decrease significantly. There is a possibility that in the December 2023 financial statements, UBank’s deposits will have been reduced by 38%, or even halved. This is because the top 10 institutional deposits account for 50% of UBank’s total deposits, and this could lead to a significant reduction from the celebrated Rs 100 billion figure touted by Kabeer Naqvi. There is also a possibility that by year-end, PTCL Group will restore confidence in UBank, and any deposits that left the bank will return.\n",
            "The same senior official from one of the depositors of UBank commented that everything will be clear once UBank publish accounts which are expected around mid-November. Furthermore, the official mentioned that, in line with the statement by the CEO of PTCL, there is no requirement for an additional infusion of equity into UBank.\n",
            "For now, the future of UBank remains shrouded in mystery, as the institution is yet to release its 2023 second-quarter financial statements. Thus we will have to wait till next year, when the year-end 2023 audited accounts of UBank are published, to see what happened. \n",

            "; distribution of national income. There are different ways of studying distribution of national income in an economy. Before I elaborate let’s understand how national income or GDP can be divided among people. We know that people earn their incomes in different ways in an economy. Most people we know work for somebody else. They provide their labour to firms, and in return earn wages and salaries. Then there are some who own their own firms and earn profits. There is also a third kind, called rentiers. They neither work nor own a firm but live off on rental income. For simplicity we assume that we are considering an economy that only has workers and owners of firms. How do people earn their income in this simple economy? Well, workers earn a wage from the firm they are employed at and firm owners or capitalists receive profits. Collectively these two i.e. workers’ wages and capitalists’ profits add up to make the national income or the GDP. So we can say that GDP of an economy can be divided into two parts – the wage part consisting of the sum of wages received by all the workers and the profit part comprising the sum of all the profits earned by the total number of firms in the economy. Let’s call them wage share and profit share. Since they are shares out of the GDP therefore if we know one, we can easily calculate the other by simple subtraction.\n",
            "Another way of studying income distribution is to divide all households in an economy in equal income groups. For example a decile would have 10 equal groups and a quintile would consist of 5 equal groups. In my first column I talked about how much of the national income was owned by the top 20% of the households in Pakistan. I had quoted a study that investigated income distribution in the Pakistani economy. Both methods have their pros and cons. For instance, top 20% households would have both high salary earners as well as high profit earners. Wage and profit shares on the other hand tell us the distribution of income between the two factors of production. Wage share would include both high and low income earners just the same way profit share would include high and low profit making firms. But importantly, factor shares of income can also tell us something about the conflict between workers and capitalists. Capitalists or firm owners want to earn as much profit as they could, while the workers would want to push for higher and higher wages. Both come from the output that the workers produce. Capitalists and workers can then be thought of trying to capture as big a share of output as they could, respectively. This conflict over output share also tells us the distribution of output between the firm owners and the workers.\n",
            "Economic theory also tells us a link between wage share and economic activity i.e. whether wage share and GDP are linked. We usually track this by finding a link between growth rates of wage share and the real GDP (real GDP is GDP adjusted for inflation). Normally the causal link runs from the growth rate of wage share to real GDP growth rate.\n",
            "Figure one below shows the share of workers in national income in Pakistan over the past decade with the real GDP growth rate. Wage share is shown on the left axis while real GDP growth rate is shown on the right axis.\n",
            "Before I comment on the graph above, a word about the data. Normally, wage share is calculated by data collected in labour force surveys. The idea is that the survey is a thorough exercise that collects information on workers’ earning in different sectors and income levels in the economy. The survey is representative and the data collected can be used to calculate national averages. However, Pakistan’s labour force surveys do not allow us to calculate workers’ wage share directly from the data. The reason being that in Pakistan a large section of the workforce is self employed and/or doing family labour. These categories do not report their income the same way workers employed at a firm would. This makes it difficult to calculate wage share directly. Then there is the added difficulty of the reliability of data. Household income and labour force surveys carried out in Pakistan are known for not collecting data from the upper echelons of income levels. So one has to often take the numbers not just with a pinch, but a bag full of salt. However, despite these difficulties and challenges, labour share of income can still be imputed using different techniques. One such estimation is done by the International Labour Organization (ILO). The data used in figure 1 above comes from the ILO’s modelled estimates. These estimates can vary from year to year depending on the methodology used. For example, I have the most recent ILO numbers and also one from a couple of years ago. The most recent numbers show a higher wage share (higher by 5-6%) for the same year than the previous data! Which numbers do we trust then? But more importantly what does this say about the imputation exercise itself?\n",
            "As a general thumb rule we can go with the most recent data set. Further, we can assume that the data for each year may not be reliable but the overall trend may be reflective of the actual situation. Like all other social sciences, economic analysis is also constrained by the information available. We just have to make do with what is available rather than what we wish was there!\n",
            "We can see in the figure 1 above that there is a slow upward trend in the wage share and that it mostly moves between 45% to 50% range. This kind of stability is not unexpected. Wage share’s upward trend post 2008 could be because of increased welfare transfers to the poor after 2008 (BISP and all). Welfare transfers to the workers are counted in their total earnings. It could also mean that the successive increases in the minimum wage levels have contributed towards an upward pressure on real wages despite poor implementation. Note how the wage share rises during the two periods of slow economic growth (2009-2012 and post 2018)) but falls when the economy grows at a higher pace (2013-18). One possible reason could be that when economic growth is slow the profits earned by the firm take an immediate hit, while wages adjust more sluggishly. Similarly, during periods of high growth profit share grows more quickly than wages do. However, one would have to dive deeper into the data to ascertain what’s really going on here. We won’t do that today. Figure 2 below shows the growth of wage share with the growth rate of real GDP below. Wage share growth rate is shown on the left axis and real GDP is on the right axis.\n",
            "Figure 2: Growth rate of Wage Share with Real GDP Growth Rate\n",
            "One can see there is a lot more volatility in the growth rate of wage share and there does seem to be a (weakish) link between wage share growth rate and economic activity. However, it is not possible to say whether GDP growth rate causes wage share to grow or vice versa. We would again have to dive deeper into the data to ascertain the causal link here.\n",
            "In summary, today we tried to learn how studying distribution of national income can be helpful in understanding how the economy behaves. We realised that this distribution may hint at conflict over output between the workers and the capitalists. This conflict has other consequences than just impacting the economy but we will take those up in a future article. \n",

            "Khilji and Zampelli\n",
            " in 1991! The paper investigates the fungibility of US assistance to Pakistan and its impact on our expenditures. \n",
            "Fungibility here means if resources meant for purpose A can be directed for purpose B. Aid or Foreign assistance received for development purposes can be directed towards military purposes and vice versa. This can happen if external and internal resources are fungible. \n",
            "The paper finds evidence for fungibility of external and internal resources in Pakistan. But that isn’t the only interesting finding of the paper. I think the most striking feature of the paper is another result that has skipped the attention of most (if not all) researchers! Khilji and Zampelli find that:\n",
            "“Pakistan’s marginal propensity to spend internal and external fungible resources on public sector goods and services is approximately 0.26 implying that an additional Rs. 1 in fungible resources will raise public spending by Rs. 0.26 with Rs. 0.08 going to defense and Rs. 0.18 to nondefense. The remaining Rs. 0.74 goes into private sector consumption.”\n",

Again, it’s something that we all kind of know but it is always good to get some pointers in the right direction. \n",

            " in the same direction. This may or may not be interlinked. There is some fluctuation in the Foreign Assistance series, which is understandable. \n",
            "Foreign Assistance to Pakistan would change from year to year depending on the international situation. We can see these numbers in another way. I took the original series of two of these variables (the ones that were not changed into log form) and scaled it down (another way of saying dividing) by Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The result is shown below in Figure 2.\n",
            "So before this makes your head spin, let me quickly explain what I have done there. There are two vertical axes shown here. Read the Foreign Assistance Share on the right vertical axis and the HHFCE share on the left vertical axis. This way you can see their movements together easily. Keeping them on one axis would not have conveyed the information that you can see right now. \n",
            "We can see that there are time periods when the two series seem to be moving in the same direction and then there are times when they don’t. Again, we can’t get too excited by it but can still rejoice in the fact that there might be something there.\n",
            "After pondering over this Khilji and Zampelli paper and wondering why everyone seems to have missed the most interesting finding of the paper, I have decided to take this up as my next project. This is the new project that I mentioned in the start of this post.\n",

            "A recent conversation over what’s driving inflation got me thinking that Pakistan’s inflationary spiral is partly due to elite consumption and that there is a link between elite consumption and the government’s deficit spending through income distribution. The usual diagnosis that too much money circulating in the economy is repeated ad nauseam. This could be the case but it doesn’t really explain much – not to me at least. I like to look at the details so I thought I should look at the data and see what it throws up! My first inclination was to look at the consumption expenditure and currency in circulation in the economy. So I pulled out the data from the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP, Pakistan’s central bank) \n",
            "Handbook of Statistics on Pakistan’s Economy\n",
            " and \n",
            "Economic Surveys of Pakistan\n",
            " to look up the number for the past two decades. I specifically looked at nominal data i.e. numbers not adjusted for inflation or changes in price levels. The next thing to do was to scale it down by the nominal GDP number to get some perspective. The consumption expenditure in the economy is divided into two categories; household final consumption expenditure (HFCE) and general government final consumption expenditure (GGFCE). HFCE records all the consumption expenditure made by households on final goods and services and GGFCE records the same for the government. \n",
            "Scaling them down by the nominal GDP gives us figure 1 below. I also thought it would be interesting to see these expenditures side by side with currency-in-circulation (CIC). So I scale down CIC by GDP as well and include it in my graph. CIC is the money issued by the central bank minus what’s been removed by it from an economy. Think of CIC as the water left on the bath floor after taking a shower. You can mop it off but some is always left behind. How much you can clean depends on how good your mop is and how good you are at cleaning the floor! CIC is the same. When the economy (banks more specifically) demands money in the economy the central banks issues it to the banks. As the money is used up for transactions through cheques and cash, it starts to move into the system. It can stay there as cash or bank deposits. When the central bank wants to remove the money from the economy it mops up liquidity from the banking system and induce cash holders to deposit money in the banks. How well can the CB do its job depends on how well banked an economy is i.e. how much its citizens rely on the formal banking channels to carry out their transactions. Let’s return to figure 1 now.\n",
            "Figure 1: Households and Government’s consumption expenditures as GDP shares with currency in circulation.\n",
            "Figure 1 shows Household consumption share on the left vertical axis and government consumption and CIC shares on the left vertical axis. First up, we can see that GGFCE and CIC do not exhibit one relationship. They seem to move in opposite directions for the first ten years in our data (FY03 to FY13) after which they move in the same direction. This could be because of the dollar inflow in the first decade of the War on Terror (WoT). These inflows financed government spending and it didn’t need to borrow as much from the SBP to finance its expenditures. HFCE increases steadily from 73% to 85% in the two decades shown here. This is interesting and significant. \n",
            "The past two decades also mark a shift in the government’s strategy to spur growth in the country. The Shaukat Aziz-led finance ministry (and later the government) in the early 2000s relied on creating a consumption-led growth boom by maintaining low interest and exchange rates financed by foreign inflows. Ever since, successive governments have tried similar strategies to cause short term growth in the economy without really thinking about its negative consequences. \n",
            "For example, each one of this consumption led boom has followed a bust because once the foreign inflows (mostly aid and loans) dry up, the country runs into a balance of payment crisis i.e. it runs short of dollars to pay for its imports and service its debt. A balance of payment crisis quickly transforms into an inflationary crisis that makes the government run to the IMF. We saw this story from 2008 to 2013 and then more recently since Fall of 2021. An important part of this story is to understand the income distribution in the economy. People with higher incomes consume more. \n",
            "Pakistan National Human Development Report 2020\n",
            " calculates that Top 20% share in total national income is at 49.6% while the bottom 60% own 29.7% of the national income. Naturally consumption in the country is concentrated at the top. \n",
            "Burki et. al.\n",
            " shows that the top 10% captured 24% of the total income growth in Pakistan from 2001-02 to 2015-16 as opposed to bottom 50% that captured 32.4% in the same time period. This means that as the economy grows the rich keep getting richer while the poor continue to struggle.\n",
            "When the government spends money in the economy to spur growth, that money changes into income for firm owners and workers. As we have seen that the rich own most of the income and benefit disproportionately from economic growth, we can safely assume that most of government expenditure is captured by the rich as income. The rich then go on and spend this new income on things that they like to consume – again safe to assume that these consist of luxury imported goods. \n",
            "I would like to argue that the rich also have a high demand for money because of their desire to park their wealth in the real estate sector. We know this sector is largely undocumented i.e. the transactions documented here do not necessarily get recorded. Further, no taxes are paid either on the transactions or the profits earned by the seller and/or the broker. Both these factors – rich capturing a disproportionate income share and their consumption – can be inflationary if they remain unregulated. Taxing the rich is one way out. But more importantly we need to think seriously about distributing income in the economy in a more equitable manner. \n",
            "We also need to ensure that growth in income is also equitably distributed. How do we do that will remain a million dollar question for some time to come!\n",

            "Courting foreign investors in a dollar-starved economy is a rite of passage for every successive government. As we speak, pledges are being sought from Middle Eastern investors and efforts are underway to divest a batch of state-owned enterprises. And why not, one may ask. After all, some of the largest economies in the world such as US, China, Hong Kong, Germany or Netherlands are as much investor economies as investee economies. \n",
            "Indeed, where FDI results in the transfer of capital, technology and expertise to address a country’s unique pain points or generates employment and improves the balance of payment, it is a worthy pursuit. Yet, in Pakistan’s context, such benefits are vanishingly uncommon. Seven decades of ad hoc policies ushering investments, and fifty billion in FDI dollars later, there is nary a sector that is regionally competitive without subsidies or trade protections. Past experiences from across industries, whether consumer goods, communications or utilities suggest that when left on their own, manufacturing enterprises gravitate towards trading and the service industry lets the quality degrade to avoid reinvesting in people, processes, and infrastructure. Meanwhile, the overall economic activity continues to be defined by a conspicuous absence of food security, energy security, human development, and climate action – a state of deprivation made worse only by the hard currency demands of these businesses. \n",
            "Just as government policies on investments are often motivated by political expediency rather than long-term capacity building, unsurprisingly, the capital we tend to attract is similarly opportunistic. Annual foreign direct investments in excess of a billion dollars a year began entering the country in the early 2000s. A third of this capital propped up the power infrastructure, which has historically offered a wide range of incentives to investors including guaranteed sales, dollar IRRs  in the 20% ballpark and favourable taxation. It would have been wonderful to report win-win outcomes for both the public and the investors, except that the consumers are now burdened by capacity payments owed to imported fossil-fuel based IPPs that are dispatched at half their available capacity. I can reach across the table and say that the governments did what had to be done to bring significant electricity generation capacity online within a relatively ambitious timeframe, but the caveat remains: there is still no energy security for Pakistan without access to and control over generation inputs. \n",
            "One doesn’t have to look hard to find other examples where short-termism of the policymakers has placed us squarely in the eye of the balance of payment storm for sectors that are not quite as strategic as energy. Take the automobile industry for instance, featuring on the priority list of the Board of Investment, where capital was solicited under the Automotive Development Policy 2016-21. To assess the efficacy of such FDI through the balance of payment lens, we can look at a typical assembler’s transactions with their stakeholders, that is, capital providers, contractors, customers and input suppliers during the business lifecycle. \n",
            "Let’s begin with cashflows during the investment and pre-commissioning period. For most capital-intensive projects, it is a fair assumption that the engineering, procurement and construction contract would be awarded to experienced international firms who are often subsidiaries or affiliates of the offshore investor. The contracts would be remunerated in dollars and be 50%-70% of the total capital cost of the undertaking. We also expect that these projects would be leveraged such that the debt component would pay for 50%-80% of the assets of the company. A back of the envelope calculation indicates that for every $100 in invested equity, there is an outflow of $100 to $350 for imported equipment and technical services, from the get-go. Note that I haven’t even considered joint venture arrangements where the foreign equity component is actually a fraction of the total investment, nevertheless entitling them to sell components, spares or fully built vehicles to the Pakistan operations under long-term contracts.  \n",
            "The next cash outflow on the agenda is the return on capital owed to foreign investors, which like the initial investment, is independent of the nature of the business. Since Pakistan is a frontier market with a high degree of political risk, macroeconomic imbalances, precarious security situation and questionable infrastructure, the return levels that incentivize foreign investors tend to be in the double digits with typical payback periods averaging at five years or lower while profit repatriation would happen throughout the life of the business. So again, hard currency outflows far exceed the original investment inflows when considered over longer time horizons. \n",
            "The litmus test for long-term desirability of these enterprises is in how they impact the trade gap during their operations phase. There are four possibilities that determine whether the business is a net consumer or producer of dollars: \n",
            "A: The inputs are paid for in rupees and sales are also generated in rupees\n",
            "B: The inputs are paid for in rupees and sales are generated in dollars\n",
            "C: The inputs are paid for in dollars and sales are generated in dollars\n",
            "D: The inputs are paid for in dollars and sales are generated in rupees\n",
            "It is easy to see that B is the most favourable scenario. A & C are quite acceptable, while D spells trouble. Any CBU and CKD kit reliant automobile assembler would fall squarely in category D, even before we consider secondary effects such as putting more gasoline-chugging, carbon-emitting, private vehicles on our crumbling roads. \n",
            "A review of data from the State Bank of Pakistan provides support for this thesis. The cumulative Net FDI in all sectors of the economy during the seven years from 2016-2022 has been $15.2 billion, while profit repatriation was $11 billion. Foreign inflows in the power sector were estimated at $5 billion while $7.6 billion worth of equipment was imported, some of it for renewable energy and indigenous coal-based plants. Data for auto industry’s initial capex is not identified separately by the SBP but their operating inputs, being CKD kits, stood at $9.4 billion for the same period. \n",
            "My analysis would not be so grim, had Pakistan been an attractive market, with far more greenbacks flowing in with each passing year, than leaving the ecosystem. Or if we were building our own turbines or industrial robots or self-winding watches. Or tens of thousands were being employed at a decent living wage and upskilled. Or if the businesses were so competitive, that they would export their output globally and pay meaningful taxes too. \n",
            "This gap between what could have been and isn’t, makes it clear that the “Come one, come all!” approach to FDI needs a rethink. The policymakers must discriminate and direct incoming funding to sectors that align with the country’s long-term goals for economic prosperity, preferably in areas where we have or could acquire a competitive advantage. Investors must also be held to standards of conduct, to not indulge in exploitative business practices on product or service pricing, or wages and working conditions, or contribute to environmental degradation. Should they acquire significant market power, one must remember Russia as a cautionary example where at least a thousand foreign firms curtailed operations recently, leaving significant gaps in provision of goods and services. \n",

            "In today’s digital era, the very idea of a security breach can cause severe consternation. So one can imagine the concern when on September 20, there were news reports of a data breach at Indolj, a Pakistani restaurant technology provider. Specifically, local media outlets reported that a sample database of customers who use Indolj had been compromised – and more worryingly, that this database contained the customers’ personal and payment information of customers. What actually happened? Profit finds out.\n",
            "Indolj is a commission-free online ordering system and food ordering app that helps restaurants cater to their customers’ food orders. It also provides all-in-one technology solutions for restaurants, including websites with online ordering, POS, digital menu boards and digital marketing.\n",
            "On September 20, Profit received a sample database that was allegedly selling data of approximately 2.2 million Indolj customers. This same database was received by other media outlets, such as GEO News, which reported on the topic on September 20, and ProPakistani, which reported on it two days later. The database included the names of customers, their email addresses, their phone numbers, along with other information. \n",
            "Profit carried out an analysis to verify the authenticity of the information leaked. This was done by contacting a pool of around 30 customers whose details were mentioned. We were able to confirm the names and numbers of these customers; however, approximately only 15 email addresses matched the ones in the database. \n",
            "While it had been initially claimed that customers’ credit card information had also been breached, there was no proof of this in the database. Additionally, the physical addresses of customers were also not present in the sample data, which means that there is no confirmation of that particular data being leaked. \n",
            "Profit spoke to both Indolj’s CEO Saad Jandga, and Wah Brands CEO Athar Chawla, who has closely worked with Indolj and used their services for his brands. Both individuals confirmed that details like the names and phone numbers of any customer registered are common and usually available. Both also said that anyone with a mobile number receives numerous promotional and marketing calls on a daily basis, so this is not something that people should panic about. \n",
            "Breaching into the systems and leaking sensitive customer data is unusual, however, “such unethical practices are often carried out by competitors, when a platform is growing,” Chawla said.\n",
            "He added the report’s use of fabricated data such as some email addresses and phone numbers doesn’t provide any evidence of Indolj’s sensitive data being compromised.\n",
            "Jangda reiterated the platform doesn’t require customers to provide sensitive data. He also said the team received the database around the same time as everyone else did and took immediate action. They carried out an analysis to verify the data themselves, as well as with their clients, which showed that only a small fraction (approximately 5%) matched the data at the secure back-end database.\n",
            "“This inconsistency raises serious doubts about the authenticity of the reported data breach,” Saad told this newspaper.\n",
            "Indolj is a service provider that does not require any customer to save their credit card information. However, the restaurants that use the platform’s services and offer an online payment option to their customers use a payment gateway. These are offered either by Foree, Bank Alfalah or HBL. Jangda said Indolj does not store any data as payments are made through the gateway portal alone. This was confirmed by security expert Rafay Baloch, who said Indolj is not Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) compliant. Only PCI compliant companies can store data. \n",
            "“Indolj users enter their credit card information every time unless the portal asks them to save the information. Even in that case, the information is not with Indolj,” Saad stated.\n",
            "“The report includes a credit card column, but Indolj never stores payment information, making any claim of credit card data leakage impossible,” Chawla said, further stating that an OTP is requested from users every time an online payment is made on their restaurants.\n",
            "In this case, credit card numbers were not included in the database. Even if they had been included, an individual would have to also know a customer’s pin, along with the credit card info to make a transaction. The chance of fraud increases when both the credit card number and pin are available.\n",
            " \n",
            "It means that your systems are secure, reducing the chances of data breaches. Merchants and payment service providers (PSPs) handling card data must maintain PCI compliance. It encompasses technical and operational standards that businesses must adhere to to protect cardholders’ credit card data during processing. Being PCI compliant, a merchant needs to undergo rigorous security measures and audits to ensure data protection.\n",
            " \n",
            "Our analysis shows that breach may not be so serious as no sensitive data has been leaked. This is because merchants who are not PCI compliant do not store sensitive information. \n",
            " \n",
            "Indolj has said that it has robust security measures and is continuously updating its security protocols to avoid such threats in the future. Additionally, the service provider is pursuing legal action through FIA Cyber Crime to hold those responsible for this incident accountable. They have also engaged certified security consultants to investigate this further.\n",

            "Pakistan’s online jobs platform Rozee.com today announced the launch of an indigenous freelancing platform for Pakistani professionals, called Azadee. \n",
            "Rozee built this platform on the back of what they say are 10 million skilled professionals and freelancers on the Rozee platform, with 100,000 employers in Pakistan. The launch comes during a tough time for the economy as inflation peaks, businesses are either closing or laying people off, whereas increments are in short supply. \n",
            "“Local freelancing is almost non-existent even though Pakistan is the 5th largest country in terms of international freelancers,” says Rahman. “Since many of the freelancers are already there with us on Rozee and other professionals are also very skilled, we are allowing our employers to post projects for instance for an android app or for making a logo.”\n",
            "According to Rozee, its jobs data shows a 30% decline in hiring over the last 16 months. As conditions for businesses get tough, Azadee will enable these businesses to commission projects to skilled professionals instead of hiring workers full-time, providing an income stream to such professionals and helping companies find workers.\n",
            "Monis says that short-term employment is already happening and it makes more sense in the current economic conditions, therefore, it does not cannibalize the existing hiring feature of Rozee. “In fact, the companies would be happy because they already hire either full-time or on a contractual employment basis. Instead of hiring a full-time employee for getting an Android app made, they can now freelance it to a skilled worker.”\n",
            "“The fintech platform reshapes Pakistan’s freelance landscape by offering virtually endless opportunities for freelancers and businesses alike. Instead of traditional full-time hires that incur substantial costs, this platform allows employers to supplement their workforce and continue to grow on lean budgets,” Shahid Kazi, CEO of Rozee said.\n",
            "Besides being a platform connecting professionals with companies for freelancing projects, Rozee will ensure payments are made when projects conclude, and execute formal agreements between parties.\n",
            "The Azadee launch comes on the side of the launch of Rozee’s financial wellness platform Rizq, which Rahman dubs a super-app for freelancers and professionals. Through the Rizq app, professionals and freelancers can save, invest and manage money.\n",
            "Some of the features of the Rizq app would allow professionals and freelancers to invest in mutual funds, join ROSCAs (more commonly known as committees), and access loans through Rozee’s partner financial institutions. The Rizq app would also allow them to find side hustles through the Azadee platform.  \n",
            "“We believe Azadee can be a shot in the arm to boost a slowing economy constrained by cashflows,” said Monis Rahman. “We believe significant economic activity can be generated by re-introducing our talented professionals and employers to each other through freelancing relationships. Many of these newly minted freelancers will become entrepreneurs and attract international projects and much-needed foreign exchange.”\n",

            "The music industry in Pakistan has witnessed significant growth and evolution in recent years. With a rich musical heritage and a large population of music enthusiasts, Pakistan has become a vibrant market for music consumption and production. Traditionally, the music industry relied heavily on physical music sales, such as CDs and cassettes, as well as television and radio airplay. However, with the development of digital technology, the landscape has transformed. Online streaming platforms have gained prominence as the preferred method of music consumption.\n",
            "One notable addition to the Pakistani music scene was the introduction of Spotify in 2021 as an online streaming platform. With a huge library of local and international music, this platform has had a significant impact on the way people access and discover music in the country. It provided Pakistani artists with a platform to showcase their work to a wider audience. Having said that, it allows users to stream music on-demand, create personalized playlists, and discover new artists and genres. Spotify’s algorithms also provide recommendations based on users’ listening habits, further enhancing the music discovery experience.\n",
            "But what does this mean for existing online streaming platforms in Pakistan? Is Spotify going to sustain itself in this market? We find out…\n",
            "Spotify offers a new avenue for distribution and monetization for musicians. They can upload their music to the platform, potentially reaching millions of listeners worldwide. Moreover, Spotify’s analytics and data insights enable artists to gain valuable information about their audience and tailor their marketing strategies accordingly.\n",
            "The arrival of Spotify in Pakistan has brought competition to the existing online streaming market. Local streaming platforms, such as Patari and Saarey Music, have also been popular among Pakistani listeners. What sets each platform apart, in terms of its business model, number of subscribers and how they plan to sustain itself?\n",
            "Article continues after this advertisement\n",
            "When we talk about Spotify, it made a fan base in the country much before it decided to launch here. We spoke to the Spotify Pakistan team who told us that the way it generates revenue is from both brand advertisements on the free service and users who pay for subscriptions.\n",
            "The platform uses a Freemium model which allows users to choose the tier that works best for them. It introduces users to the Free service and then offers subscriptions. Payments can be made via cards or local partnerships. The updated ad-supported Free experience in Pakistan allows users to choose any song, skip tracks, and stay connected to new releases. Premium offerings provide uninterrupted, ad-free music and cater to different user needs with plans for students, couples, families, and more. Increased engagement leads to growth in the advertising business and subscription base. Spotify aims to increase monetization and subscriber growth throughout the life cycles of its listeners.\n",
            "Spotify shares 70% of revenues with the rights holders. It has paid over $30 billion in royalties to the music industry, contributing to major music and record labels earning over $4 billion in profits in 2021. \n",
            "Faisal Sherjan, a founding member of Patari, launched in 2015 and was one of the pioneering online streaming platforms in Pakistan, told Profit that the platform started with a realization that artists needed to be paid for their work to sustain their careers. The founders understood the market dynamics and had expertise in monetizing music.\n",
            "He stated that the platform initially faced difficulties due to the lack of micropayment options and the high revenue share demanded by mobile networks of around 70%. To support the platform, sponsorships were sought, but these were primarily focused on branding rather than directly benefiting the artists. \n",
            "“The monetization aspect remained a challenge for Patari. Unlike Spotify, which expanded to Pakistan without creating specific features for the local market, Patari had to navigate the complexities of the Pakistani music industry,” Faisal told Profit.\n",
            "Patari differentiated itself by exclusively focusing on Pakistani music, showcasing the country’s diverse sounds and creativity. It aimed to promote and highlight local talent rather than relying on popular Indian item songs, which were dominant at that time. Over time, it expanded its offerings beyond music to include podcasts and audio literature, making Urdu literature more accessible through audio files.\n",
            "Patari’s current user numbers are not readily available, as the platform has not been actively promoted or marketed recently. However, it is estimated to have around 20,000 to 25,000 active users, with minimal costs involved in maintaining the platform.\n",
            "In Q1 2023, Spotify achieved its strongest performance since going public in 2018. Monthly Active Users increased by 22% YoY to 515 million, driven by all age groups and markets. Premium Subscribers grew by 15% YoY to 210 million, with Europe and Latin America leading the way. Total revenue reached €3.0 billion, a 14% YoY growth, primarily attributed to subscriber gains. Gross Margin improved to 25.2%, reflecting enhanced profitability in music and podcasts. Operating loss/income stood at €156 million, benefiting from reduced marketing expenses.\n",
            "Similarly, Faraan Irfan, Founder of Saarey Music spoke to \n",
            "Profit\n",
            " about how the platform works. “It is a digital music platform focused on providing access to South Asian classical music. The sustainability of their focus on classical music in Pakistan has been surprisingly successful. The platform was initially launched as a passion project to provide access to quality music and they have received a grant from the UK government to build their platform and plan to generate revenue through subscription fees, service fees for transactions and bookings, and institutional subscriptions”, he said. \n",
            "“The subscription fee for Pakistan is Rs 490/- per month, and we offer monthly, half-yearly, and yearly plans for individuals. The platform also has institutional plans starting at $1,000, allowing universities and other organizations to use the platform for research, classrooms, and events,” he said.\n",
            "Since 2022, Saarey Music has experienced significant growth with a 70x increase. Although the total number of subscribers remains undisclosed, it is mentioned that they have surpassed half a million users. Their user base comprises mostly 18–35-year-olds, with 53% falling within this age range. Moreso, 70% of their users consider themselves beginners to the genre, highlighting the appeal of accessing classical music. The retention of paid subscribers is exceptionally high at 94% per month, compared to an industry average of less than 20%. This suggests that classical music has a special appeal that larger streaming services have not fully realized.\n",
            "Spotify prioritizes supporting musicians and songwriters, maintaining the same approach in Pakistan as in other markets. The platform stimulates industry growth and ensures fair compensation for rights holders. Having said that, \n",
            "Profit\n",
            " spoke to Roshaan Sherwani of Hassan and Roshaan, a Lahore-based pop duo who told us how Spotify works every time they release a new song on the platform. \n",
            "“Spotify has impacted the music scene in Pakistan in a positive way as it is the only major streaming platform that is operating in the country. This way the musicians are getting to thrive on an internationally popular streaming service which means greater exposure to audiences outside Pakistan as well,” the singer said. \n",
            "This is majorly why a large number of local audiences are subscribing to the platform as the marketing strategy for the platform in Spotify is catering to the interest of the listeners in the sense that the advertisement campaigns and promotions are tailored for the Pakistani audience.\n",
            "“We use a platform called DistroKid to distribute our music to every major streaming service, including Spotify, Apple Music, Shazam etc,” Roshaan told Profit. He further added that “Spotify gives out (significant) royalties to artists unlike previously used platforms in Pakistan; the more popular their page the greater the royalties per stream.” This has encouraged music creators to make a decent earning from their music, similar to what YouTube did for video creators. \n",
            "This was further put into perspective when Hassan & Roshaan’s Manager Nael Hafeez told us that Spotify Pakistan has a large number of subscribers as compared to Apple Music and other music streaming platforms, which aren’t as present in this market as yet. He also gave us an insight into how record labels work, which started to grow in the last 2-3 years. A label invests in artist(s) and doesn’t thrive on distribution per se.\n",
            "When it comes to big distributors like EROS, and Sony Music the music that gets uploaded on their YouTube platform is enough for an artist to get the exposure he needs. However, labels distribute on behalf of the artist under their name and keep a certain percentage of the royalties. For Hassan & Roshaan, DistroKid had a fixed yearly fee of about $35 with no commissions. That means the artist gets to keep all the proceeds. \n",
            "Roshaan also stated that their monthly listeners on Spotify are about 550,000 (Total streams in the last 28 days have been 1.6 million) and for Apple Music, they have a total of about 42,000 listeners (total streams in the last 28 days have totalled up to 80,000). The contrast between the two platforms is mainly due to Spotify’s presence in Pakistan and Apple Music’s absence, which shows the impact Spotify’s arrival has made. \n",
            "Comparably, Patari was there at a time when piracy sites and unauthorized music downloads were prevalent. The Pakistani music industry faced challenges related to copyrights and monetization, as artists relied mainly on live performances to earn money. Patari aimed to change this by providing a platform where artists could monetize their music and listeners could pay for access. When the platform was launched, it was the first to pay royalties to the musicians. According to data available online, established musicians like Noori and Strings made between Rs 180,000 to 200,000 whereas aspiring musicians managed to earn between Rs10,000 to 30,000 at the time. \n",
            " \n",
            "Similarly, Faisal Sherjan stated that Patari requires investment for technology upgrades and promotional activities to remain in the picture.\n",
            "“A potential model for the platform’s future sustainability is a channel inspired by YouTube’s Patreon channel,” he said, adding that it is a place for artists/bands to build memberships by providing exclusive access to their work with a monthly fee which contributes a certain amount to enable them to produce more music. With the advancement of micropayment options, this model could be more feasible now.\n",
            "Moreso, Faraan said that when it comes to exclusive rights to all recordings from Pakistan, Saarey Music has rights to around 85-90% of them. They prioritize quality music and have a process in place for artists to submit their content. The platform takes care of various aspects, such as editing, mixing, publishing, marketing, and album covers. The services they offer to artists cost around $3,000 to $10,000 per album.\n",
            "However, the platform does not provide any royalties to artists, as they believe the promise of artists making money from streaming services is often false. “The focus is on providing artists with exposure, paid performances, and access to a global audience. Permission is sought from artists before releasing their music, ensuring their involvement in the process,” Faraan affirmed.\n",
            "In terms of revenue, Saarey Music has not focused on monetization initially but plans to start doing so now. The growth in revenue last year was approximately 165% and had a high gross margin of 82% in contrast to the industry standard of around 30% for streaming services like Spotify. \n",
            "The Spotify representative stated that the platform provides opportunities for more creators to succeed by providing different programs for these artists. \n",
            "‘Spotify for Artists’ onboards young musicians and their management teams, educating them on the platform’s benefits. In Pakistan, Spotify launched the ‘Fresh Finds Pakistan playlist’, promoting independent artists and helping them gain global recognition. The EQUAL program in Pakistan highlights female musicians, with ambassadors featured on Times Square billboards, expanding their listenership worldwide. \n",
            "Not only that, Spotify conducted Masterclasses in Karachi and Lahore, covering topics like Spotify for Artists’ tools, release planning, and utilizing the Loud and Clear platform for transparent monetary payouts. These initiatives empower independent and female artists while fostering growth in the music industry. \n",
            " \n",
            "The answer seems likely as partnerships with various brands are a good strategy to stay in business. Spotify has partnered with Velo Sound Station and Coke Studio Pakistan which is a great way to promote Pakistani music to a global audience. Spotify has a large user base and this way they can reach a wider audience than ever before.\n",
            "Spotify partnered with Coke Studio for the first time in 2022 and with Coke Studio Pakistan it provides users an immersive audio experience through new releases and curated playlists. It hosts all Coke Studio songs and artists previously featured on CS, thus, through this partnership, all CS artists are now able to share their work with the global reach to fans all over the world.\n",
            "Similarly, the tracks from the second season of VELO Sound Station are now available on Spotify, and the artists and songs are set to appear on a global stage. With Spotify being available to 515 million users in 183 countries, the collaboration between these two music culture powerhouses brings users the content they love and makes it easier than ever to listen to songs from the emerging format of music that is reimagined with modern touches.\n",
            "In conclusion, pioneering platforms like Patari and Saarey Music have played significant roles in shaping the industry and provided a platform for Pakistani artists to earn money and promote local talent. However, with the introduction of Spotify in Pakistan, the music industry is expected to adapt, thrive, and attract more streaming services and music labels in the future, fostering a stronger musical culture in the country. The future for the Pakistani music industry seems very bright with the presence of a major streaming service and a thriving musical culture. If it continues like this, we are hopeful that we will be introduced to many more streaming services and platforms like Spotify will continue creating some \n",

            "The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) marked a significant stride in economic development by registering 2,463 new companies in the month of October 2023. This surge brings the total number of registered companies to an impressive 205,456, with a cumulative capitalization of PKR 4.24 billion for the newly incorporated entities.\n",
            "A breakdown of the registered companies reveals that 56% opted for the private limited company structure, while 41% chose to register as single-member companies. The remaining 3% diversified into public unlisted companies, not-for-profit associations, trade organizations, limited liability partnerships (LLPs), and foreign companies. Remarkably, nearly 99.6% of these registrations were processed online, showcasing the SECP’s commitment to digitization.\n",
            "The IT sector emerged as the frontrunner in incorporations, boasting 326 new companies. It was closely followed by trading (322), services (298), real estate development & construction (290), education (107), tourism (100), food & beverages (90), ecommerce, and mining & quarrying (67 each). Other sectors contributing to this surge include corporate agricultural farming, marketing & advertisement, textile, pharmaceutical, transport, engineering, chemical, power generation, healthcare, cosmetics & toiletries, broadcasting & telecasting, lodging, communications, cables & electrical goods, and paper & board.\n",
            "The SECP’s integration with the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and provincial departments has streamlined the registration process. A total of 2,281 companies used the SECP eService for registration with FBR, while 61 companies secured registration with the Employees Old Age Benefit Institute (EOBI). Additionally, 27 companies obtained registration with PESSI/SESSI, and 34 companies completed the registration process with the excise and taxation departments.\n",

            "ISLAMABAD: The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) has taken a decisive step towards streamlining the Initial Public Offering (IPO) market by implementing a standardized approval process. A recent circular under section 172 of the Securities Act, 2015, has set a maximum period of 14 working days for the regulatory approval of listing applications and prospectuses.\n",
            "Moreover, the circular has introduced a 15-day window for the Pakistan Stock Exchange Limited (PSX) to complete the post-approval procedures for listing, marking a significant overhaul in the IPO application process. These timelines were established after extensive consultations with stakeholders, reflecting the commitment to enhancing efficiency and transparency in the IPO market.\n",
            "One of the key aspects of the revamped process is the automation of procedures, bringing in technological advancements to expedite the approval process. To ensure a swift and thorough evaluation, the Consultant to the Issue (CTI) has been assigned a pivotal role. The CTI is now tasked with conducting a detailed assessment of both the issue and the issuer, providing a due-diligence certificate that confirms the comprehensive disclosure of all material information required by law or suggested by the PSX and SECP in the prospectus.\n",
            "This strategic move by SECP is expected to make the IPO market more appealing to potential issuers and investors alike. The move to remove unnecessary red tape comes on the back of an increase in market activity in the PSX, as the benchmark KSE-100 index crosses the 55,000 milestone for the first time. It is important to note that throughout 2022, Pakistan Stock Exchange only saw 3 successful IPOs.\n",
            "The new step represents the initial phase of SECP’s broader efforts to revamp the IPO regime, with a vision to foster growth and development in the financial ecosystem. The efficient allocation of funds and the subsequent boost in local economic growth are anticipated outcomes of a more robust IPO market.\n",
            "The circular, effective immediately, is meant to serve as a directive to all stakeholders, including PSX, CTIs, book runners, issuers, and other market participants, urging them to adhere to the standardized approval process. This regulatory shift signifies a pivotal moment in the evolution of Pakistan’s financial landscape, emphasizing the commitment to modernization and increased market attractiveness.\n",

            "The government had estimated Rs.7.3 trillion for debt servicing out of the total budget layout of Rs.14.484 trillion. However, the cost of public debt has increased due to the jacking up of policy rates by the central bank.\n",
            "It is pertinent to mention here that debt servicing is the single largest component in total expenditures. The rate of increase in defence budget, development budget, cost  of govt running expenditure were all lesser than that of debt servicing.\n",
            "The finance ministry stated that the primary concern on the expenditure side was the rise in the cost of servicing public debt. With the rise in SBP policy rates to 22% and weaker PKR fueling the rise in servicing costs, debt servicing costs increased 45% in the first quarter to Rs 1.4 trillion.\n",
            "The report states that despite the increase in debt servicing cost, the government managed to limit growth in expenditures through a prudent reduction in untargeted subsidies and a reduction in spending on new projects and schemes under the PSDP.\n",
            "The Monthly Economic Indicator (MEI) estimated for the month of September 2023 stood positive on the back of improved high frequency variables such as LSM, exports, cement despatches etc.\n",
            "MEI is expected to be positive throughout the outgoing fiscal year due to a rebound in domestic economic activities. MEI is developed as a tool to distribute the past annual GDP numbers, reported by the PBS, on a monthly/quarterly basis, and to nowcast GDP growth for the fiscal year in which the National Accounts are not yet available on the same frequency. \n",
            "According to the report, the first quarter of the current fiscal year demonstrates that the economy is yielding positive results from development and stabilisation measures. In real sector of the economy, cotton and rice production for 2023-24 has posed exceptional growth of 126.6 % and 18 %, respectively.\n",
            "Similarly, LSM increased by 2.5 % on a year-on-year basis in Aug-23 and on a month-on-month basis, it bounced back by 8.4 % against the decline of 3.7 % in July. Moreover, the external account has improved considerably and foreign exchange buffers are being built up. On the fiscal front, the government’s commitment to fiscal consolidation efforts and maintaining fiscal discipline is evident through better fiscal accounts during Jul-Aug, FY2024.\n",
            "In the coming months, it is expected that overall economic activity will remain positive throughout the outgoing fiscal year due to a rebound in domestic economic activities and improvement in inflationary pressures.\n",
            "The report also credits the recent coordinated efforts by the government organisations to address macroeconomic imbalances, which will help in realizing sustainable and inclusive economic growth in the medium-to-long term.\n",

            "The State Bank of Pakistan’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain the policy rate at 22% in a meeting held on Monday, which was in line with market expectations. \n",
            "In an analysts’ briefing following the MPC meeting, SBP Governor Jameel Ahmad said the committee was of the view the current stance was “aggressive and tight” and should continue. \n",
            "The central bank last hiked the policy rate by 100 basis points (bps) to 22% in an emergency meeting in June ahead of an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Since then, it has maintained the rate in meetings held on July 31, September 14, and October 30. \n",
            "Commenting on the latest announcement, independent economic analyst AAH Soomro said it was largely as per expectations. While some wanted a rate cut, “short term stability cannot be risked at the expense of short lived growth,” he added. \n",
            "Soomro said there was a much higher chance the MPC would slash the rate at its next meeting on December 12 as the second half of fiscal year 2024 “will see significant improvement in inflation outlook, successful IMF review and full impact of gas price hike”.\n",
            "“The forward guidance shows the worst is behind and good times are ahead,” the analyst added.  \n",
            "Following the IMF agreement, the Fund asked the SBP to maintain an appropriately tight monetary policy that counters inflation. While inflation clocked in at 31.44% in September, the SBP’s Monetary Policy Statement said it was expected to decline in October and then maintain a downward trajectory, especially in the second half of the fiscal year. It cited downward adjustments in fuel prices, easing prices of some major food commodities, and a favourable base effect for this projection.\n",
            "It acknowledged that the recent volatility in global oil prices as well as an increase in domestic gas tariffs could pose inflationary risks, but added, however, that they would be offset by targeted fiscal consolidation in fiscal year 2024’s first quarter; improvement in market availability of key commodities; and the alignment of interbank and open market exchange rates.\n",
            "The SBP’s stance regarding inflation is in line with analyst expectations. In a report released earlier this month, Topline Securities said inflation was expected to decrease because of an average decline of 11% in domestic fuel prices, stable international oil prices and the rupee’s strengthening against the dollar by 8.49% since September 5.\n",
            "Both Arif Habib Limited and Topline Securities expect average annual inflation in fiscal year 2024 to remain between\n",
            " 23-24%, compared to 29.2% in fiscal year 2023. \n",
            "But all these figures are related to headline inflation. Another measure of the effect on prices is core inflation, which removes volatile factors such as food and energy prices, when measuring inflation. And Pakistan’s core inflation has remained around 21% in the last four months. Is this figure going to remain elevated? \n",
            "Addressing this concern in the statement, the Monetary Policy Committee stated: “The fiscal policy is also contributing to the overall stabilisation measures, which, coupled with better availability of food commodities, is likely to supplement the central bank’s efforts to bring down inflation.”\n",
            "Responding to a question in the analysts’ briefing regarding the impact of the global situation — the violence in the Gaza strip, and volatility in oil prices — the SBP governor said the committee was “very closely” monitoring international commodity prices. \n",
            "“We see a number of positive things happening on the basis of which we expect the second half of fiscal year 2024 to be much better. The current stance is appropriate for [combatting] inflation and [encouraging] economic development,” he asserted. \n",
            "“We have taken into account all relevant factors and developments on the external, monetary and fiscal sides. Based on that, two points we have consistently maintained are 1- The monetary policy stance will continue to be aggressive and tight considering the agreement we reached with the IMF, and 2- The rate will be positive on a forward-looking basis,” Ahmad said. \n",
            "In simple words, the SBP expects the future inflation rate to be below the 22% interest rate it has decided to maintain. What exactly does this mean? Let’s say the interest rate offered by a bank on your deposited savings is 20%. If you kept Rs 1 lakh in that account, at the end of the year, you would have Rs 1.2 lakh. However, the annual inflation that year was 21%. This means that while the amount of money in your account increased, in real terms, you could buy less with that money because the cost would be Rs 1.21 lakh. This means the real interest rate was negative. If the real interest rate was positive — let’s say 23% — then you would have had Rs 1.23 lakh at the end of the year.\n",
            "Positive real interest rates encourage people to save and keep their money in banks as it protects them from inflation. So, raising the benchmark interest rate to a point where the real interest rate is positive means less money is going towards purchases, which decreases demand — one of the primary tools a central bank uses to curb inflation.\n",
            "The Monetary Policy Statement also contained a caveat: its outlook is based on continued fiscal consolidation and timely realisation of planned external inflows. During the briefing, SBP Governor Ahmad said the country was expected to secure the release of the second tranche, amounting to $710 million, of the $3 billion Standby Agreement with the IMF, and would also receive funding from other multilaterals. \n",
            "According to the Monetary Policy Statement, “recent data on economic activity reinforces the MPC’s earlier expectation of moderate growth for this year.” This data included a considerable increase in production of Kharif crops, moderate recovery in other key activity indicators like cement, petroleum and auto sales, and a gradual improvement in the large-scale manufacturing output in the first two months of the current fiscal year. \n",
            "Separately, there was a “substantial improvement” in the current account deficit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, while both exports and workers’ remittances improved in September over the preceding two months, the MPS noted. \n",
            "Besides this, the rupee strengthened due to administrative actions by the authorities and the government, as well as the structural reforms introduced by the SBP for exchange companies, which improved sentiments and liquidity in the foreign exchange market. This led to increased inflows in the interbank market and stabilisation in the SBP’s foreign exchange reserves which stand at $7.49 billion as of October 20. \n",
            "The SBP governor said the reserves would be shored up to $10 billion by June 2024, and the current account deficit was expected to be kept under $5 billion. \n",
            "Responding to a question regarding a decline in currency in circulation, Domestic Market & Monetary Management Department Director Amin Lodhi attributed it to three reasons: unwinding of seasonal effects such as Haj, increase in deposits due to high interest rates, and declining economic uncertainty. \n",

            "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s foreign trade faces a critical challenge with the detection of over 55 interceptions, primarily mangoes with fruit fly and without treatment, in various shipments of rice and food items destined to the European Union (EU) this year. These interceptions not only sully Pakistan’s international standing regarding food safety measures but also pose a grave threat to its exports to the EU, should these issues persist unresolved.\n",
            "Recent documents obtained shed light on the severity of the situation. A letter, dated October 4, 2023, from Pakistan’s mission in Brussels, addressed to the Ministry of Commerce and other pertinent authorities, underscores the alarming extent of the problem. The letter revealed that 39 interceptions were reported in rice consignments imported from Pakistan, with an additional 16 interceptions in non-rice food products. This interception rate of Pakistani food goods to EU member countries is very high and if these are not reduced with appropriate sanitary and phytosanitary measures, these may lead to a ban on the import of Pakistani rice in EU member countries, similar to India, which is already facing similar challenges on similar interceptions. The EU has placed Pakistan and India on the list for an increased frequency of controls on aflatoxins in rice under provisions of Regulation (EC) 669/2009.\n",
            "The interceptions in rice consignments were attributed to various factors including aflatoxins, pesticide residues, chlorpyrifos, acetamiprid, hexaconazole, imidacloprid, the presence of metal and plastic, migration of mineral oil saturated hydrocarbons (MOSH) from packaging material, and document discrepancies. These issues were identified in multiple EU member states, with Germany and Italy witnessing the highest number of interceptions. \n",
            "Aflatoxins, toxic secondary metabolites produced by Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus, were identified in the rice consignments. Aflatoxins are genotoxic and carcinogenic, posing acute and chronic health risks to humans. Pesticide residues were also found in these shipments, which can cause both acute and chronic health effects.\n",
            "According to sources, the EU has set maximum aflatoxin levels due to B1 @ 2 µg/kg and sum of B1, B2, G1, and G2 @ 4 µg/kg for imported rice and food items in EU member countries, in contrast to the Codex Alimentarius limit of 15 ppb. Additionally, EU accepts a maximum residue limit (MRL) in food items @ MRL of 0.01 mg/kg. \n",
            "However, a study of maximum aflatoxin levels in food items in Pakistan shows that Pakistani food items mostly contain aflatoxin levels above 30 µg/kg due to poor storage conditions, inappropriate packing, and defective supply chains. The food also comprises a high level of MRL due to the harvesting of crops by farmers before the recommended post-harvest interval of pesticides. This issue is further exacerbated by the expansion of pesticide labels onto other food crops like rice, maize, and vegetables without scientific justification, as well as the absence of proper regulation and standardization of pesticides by provincial agricultural departments.\n",
            "Insiders informed that the Ministry of National Food Security and Ministry of Commerce has also restricted the Department of Plant Protection from checking Aflatoxin and MRL of rice shipments exportable to EU member countries prior to the issuance of a phytosanitary certificate. Both ministries have not coordinated with the Punjab and Sindh agriculture departments and food safety authorities to arrange awareness campaigns among farmers to harvest rice crops after the recommended post-harvest interval of pesticides and improve storage and packing of food items. Instead, both ministries have facilitated rice exporters to implement food safety measures on their own without the intervention of the relevant department.\n",
            "Importantly, these interceptions did not stem from a single exporter. Six interceptions were linked to M/s Zubair Enterprises, while M/s Sarwar Foods and M/s Rice Expert each accounted for 3 interceptions. M/s Modem Rice & General Mills and several other exporters also faced scrutiny. The Department of Plant Protection, as a regulator, is responsible for restricting these exporters for further export to EU member countries until corrective measures and good manufacturing practices are implemented from farm to destination.\n",
            "Apart from rice consignments, 16 interceptions were reported for non-rice food products, including herbs, spices, nuts and seeds, mixed supari, milk and milk products, meat products, and confectionery. These interceptions were documented across various EU countries, with Germany registering the highest incidence, followed by Sweden, Slovenia, the Netherlands, Spain, France, Italy, Poland, and Portugal.\n",
            "To address this pressing issue, the letter by Pakistan’s mission in Brussels, proposes a series of strategic recommendations. These include engaging and sensitizing relevant regulatory bodies and exporters regarding European food safety regulations, advising exporters to ensure stringent compliance, and urging a reduction in the use of pesticides and fertilizers that lead to elevated levels of certain substances in rice intended for export to the EU.\n",
            "Furthermore, the letter advocates for collaborative efforts between the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of National Food Security & Research, and the Rice Exporters Association of Pakistan. However, this matter cannot be resolved without involving the Department of Plant Protection, which currently lacks the necessary technical officers. The aim is to compile a comprehensive report detailing the corrective measures implemented to prevent rice interceptions in the EU. This report, once compiled, will be shared with EU authorities to underscore the quality and safety of Pakistani rice for human consumption in the EU market.\n",
            "The Pakistani mission in Brussels has committed to monitoring the progress of these recommendations closely and will provide regular updates to the relevant authorities. The gravity of this situation cannot be overstated; it not only imperils Pakistan’s trade relations but also casts a shadow over its reputation in the global food export market. Efforts to rectify these issues must be swift and comprehensive to safeguard Pakistan’s exports and restore confidence in its products on the international stage.\n",
            "Experts believe that the absence of experts and relevant officials in key positions in concerned government departments is also contributing to the mess being created in the country’s exports.\n",
